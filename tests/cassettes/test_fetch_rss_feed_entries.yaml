        had to change some of my DNS records recently, a phrase which strikes fear
        into the heart of sysadmins everywhere.\nIt all went fine, but I definitely
        felt like I was playing with fire.</p>\n\n<p>My current domain registrar is
        <a href=\"https://www.hover.com\">Hover</a>, and the only way I can manage
        my domains is through a web dashboard on their website:</p>\n\n<picture>\n
        \ \n  <source srcset=\"/images/2024/dns_dashboard_1x.png 739w, /images/2024/dns_dashboard_2x.png
        1478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n\n
        \ <img src=\"/images/2024/dns_dashboard_1x.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a web
        dashboard. There's a table of records, one record per row, and an edit button
        on the right-hand side.\" class=\"screenshot\" width=\"739\">\n</picture>\n\n<p>It\u2019s
        easy to make a one-off change in this dashboard, but it\u2019s harder to manage
        a set of DNS records over a long period.\nThere are two big things it\u2019s
        missing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>No documentation \u2013 there\u2019s
        nowhere to keep notes or comments, so I can\u2019t write down why I created
        a particular record or if I still need it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>No
        edit history \u2013 changes are immediate, and overwrite whatever was there
        before.\nIf I break something, there\u2019s no button to rollback or revert
        \u2013 I\u2019m expected to just know what the old, working configuration
        was, and apply that as new.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One way to get both
        of these would be to use an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool to manage my
        DNS records, which is how I\u2019ve managed DNS records at multiple jobs.\nI
        could define my DNS records in code, add inline comments, and track changes
        in Git.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there are no IaC tools for Hover \u2013 it
        doesn\u2019t even have a public API \u2013 so that approach is out.\n(If I
        was starting from scratch, one of the reasons I\u2019d pick a different domain
        registrar is so I could use a proper IaC tool.)\nI could migrate my domains
        to another service, but that\u2019s a big change and I\u2019m a bit nervous
        doing that without any sort of safety net.</p>\n\n<p>However, I\u2019ve still
        found a way to add documentation and change history to my existing setup.\nThis
        adds a safety net that makes me feel more comfortable making changes, and
        opens the door to me moving my domains elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-a-snapshot-of-my-existing-dns-records\">Getting
        a snapshot of my existing DNS records</h2>\n\n<p>This project started when
        I learnt about Alex Dalitz\u2019s gem <a href=\"https://github.com/alexdalitz/dnsruby\">dnsruby</a>,
        which lets you list DNS records in Ruby.\nHere\u2019s a simple example:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-ruby highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"nb\">require</span> <span class=\"s1\">'dnsruby'</span>  <span class=\"c1\">#

        have to know exactly which domain name and record type you want to query \u2013
        I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy way to get all the DNS records for
        a particular domain, especially if you want to include all the subdomains.\nThis
        is a limitation of DNS, not the dnsruby gem.</p>\n\n<p>But that\u2019s not
        an issue for me, because I know what subdomains and record types I\u2019m
        using \u2013 I can read them out of my web dashboard.\nBy iterating over the
        possible domains and record types, I wrote a script that gets all my DNS records
        and saves them to a YAML file:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-ruby highlighter-rouge\"><div

        a little snippet of the YAML it produces:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>---\nalexwlchan.net
        NS:\n- ns1.hover.com.\n- ns2.hover.com.\nalexwlchan.net MX:\n- 20 in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.\n-
        10 in1-smtp.messagingengine.com.\nalexwlchan.net A:\n- 75.2.60.5\n\u2026\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This
        is already an improvement on what I had before \u2013 if I run this script
        on a schedule, I\u2019ll have snapshots of what my DNS looked like on a particular
        date.\nI could use that to construct an edit history, and it would make it
        easier for me to revert a bad change.\nIf I make a change and break something,
        I can look at a previous snapshot to see what working configuration I should
        re-apply.</p>\n\n<p>And now I have my DNS records in a plaintext file, I can
        add comments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-documentation-to-my-dns-snapshots\">Adding
        documentation to my DNS snapshots</h2>\n\n<p>I started rearranging one of
        these YAML snapshots, grouping similar records from different domains and
        adding comments to explain what they\u2019re for.\nFor example, I can add
        a comment to remind me where the IP\_address <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">75.2.60.5</code> comes from:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>#
        == Netlify DNS records ==\n#\n# These are DNS records that allow me to use
        my own domains with my sites\n# hosted on Netlify.\n#\n# See https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/\n\nalexwlchan.net
        A:   [ \"75.2.60.5\", ]\nalexwlchan.com A:   [ \"75.2.60.5\", ]\nalexwlchan.co.uk
        A: [ \"75.2.60.5\", ]\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>I went through the
        snapshot and added a comment for every DNS record \u2013 now I know why created
        each record.\nIt took a while, but now I have a much better understanding
        of what my DNS is doing, and what\u2019s safe to change in the future.\nYou
        can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/alexwlchan.net/blob/e30e26d135b6e94cc28a040543910be37a25019f/dns/dns_records.yml\">fully-commented
        file</a> on GitHub.\nThis file is now the canonical statement of what my DNS
        records should be.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a second script that can compare two
        YAML snapshots: do my live DNS records match this canonical statement?</p>\n\n<div

        more reassurance when I copy DNS records between providers.\nFirst, I copy
        my existing DNS records into the new provider.\nThen, I use dnsruby to get
        snapshots of the DNS records being served by my old/new provider\u2019s nameservers.\nFinally,
        I compare the two snapshots to check they match.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, I could
        do this <em>before I switch the domain to the new provider\u2019s nameservers</em>.\nThis
        gives me time to test, to iterate, to fix silly mistakes, and I can do so
        at a relaxed pace without worrying if my site/email are down.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>You
        can see the complete code <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/alexwlchan.net/tree/main/dns\">on
        GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These two scripts allow me to do regular checks of my
        DNS.\nI have them set to run as a daily job in GitHub Actions.\nFirst, I create
        a snapshot of my live DNS records.\nThen, I compare those records to the canonical
        statement of what I expect my DNS to be.\nIf the two have diverged, the job
        will fail and I\u2019ll get an alert, and I\u2019ll go to investigate.</p>\n\n<p>I
        can also run the check on demand, if I\u2019m actively making changes.</p>\n\n<p>This
        doesn\u2019t change anything in Hover or the way I manage my DNS records,
        but it\u2019s done wonders for my peace of mind.\nI now have some written
        documentation about all of my DNS records are for, and I have an edit history
        so I can easily revert any breaking changes.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting

        month, I was in Paris for the <a href=\"https://netpreserve.org/ga2024/\">IIPC
        Web Archiving Conference</a>, a two-day event to discuss the preservation
        of websites and social media.\nIt was my first time attending, and I was there
        with both a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.org/\">professional</a> and a <a
        href=\"/articles/?tag=digital-preservation\">personal</a> interest.\nThis
        post has some thoughts and photos from the trip.</p>\n\n<p>I met a lot of
        smart people, and we had some thoughtful conversations about the challenges
        of web archiving.\nMost of my experience is limited to small scale projects
        \u2013 single sites or personal archives \u2013 and it was good to hear more
        about how large organisations are trying to preserve this ever-growing chunk
        of our digital heritage.\nI tend to save specific, targeted chunks of the
        web, whereas larger archives try to capture as much as they can.</p>\n\n<p>Big
        tech was a running theme.\nAn increasing chunk of the web is consolidating
        onto large, commercially-owned social media platforms.\nA few years ago, those
        companies would have freely-available APIs for downloading content en masse,
        but no more \u2013 they\u2019re all locked down now, and several speakers
        talked about how their ability to archive social media has been severely curtailed.</p>\n\n<p>AI
        was also a hot topic, another product of big tech.\nAs web archives grow and
        grow and grow, you need a way to search their contents and find the useful
        stuff.\nMultiple people showed off experiments using AI to make these large
        archives more tractable, like using AI to add more metadata to catalogue records,
        or creating automated summaries of archived TV footage.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of
        the focus was on saving web content and creating large web archives, but less
        on what we\u2019ll actually do with these archives.\nWho\u2019s using web
        archives?\nWhat do they need?\nWhat research do these web archives enable?\nThese
        feel like important questions to answer, if we want to create useful resources.\nI\u2019d
        love to see more of a focus on that at future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With
        those reflections done, here are a few photos.\nParis is a very photogenic
        city.</p>\n\n<p>The conference took place at the <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/\">Biblioth\xE8que
        nationale de France</a>, which is split across two sites.\nThe drinks reception
        was at the <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/en/the-bnfs-richelieu-site\">Richelieu
        site</a>, the home of the library for nearly 300\_years.\nIt includes a museum,
        which we got to look around before the reception:</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"/images/2024/richelieu-museum.jpg\"><picture>

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2024/creating-a-safari-webarchive/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>Recently
        I\u2019ve been trying to create a local archive of my bookmarked web pages.\nI
        already have tools to <a href=\"/2024/scheduled-screenshots/\">take screenshots</a>,
        and I love them as a way to take quick snapshots and skim the history of a
        site, but bitmap images aren\u2019t a great archival representation of a website.\nWhat
        if I also want to save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and keep an interactive
        copy of the page?</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of tools in this space; for my
        personal stuff I\u2019ve come to like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webarchive\">Safari
        webarchives</a>.\nThere are several reasons I find them appealing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p><strong>Each saved web page is stored as a single file.</strong>\nEach
        file includes the entire content of the page, and a single file per web page
        is pretty manageable.\nI can create backups, keep multiple copies, and so
        on.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>I can easily add pages to my archive
        that can\u2019t be crawled from the public web.</strong>\nLots of the modern
        web is locked behind paywalls, login screens, interstitial modals that are
        difficult for automated crawlers to get past.\nIt\u2019s much easier for me
        to get through them as a human using Safari as my default browser.\nOnce I
        have a page open, I can save it as a webarchive with the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">File &gt; Save As\u2026</code> menu item.</p>\n  </li>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p><strong>The archive can be stored locally and offline.</strong>\nIt
        will always remain available to me, as long as I keep up with backups and
        maintenance, and I can archive private web pages that I don\u2019t want to
        put in somebody else\u2019s archive.\n(For example, I wouldn\u2019t want to
        save private tweets in the publicly available Wayback Machine.)</p>\n  </li>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p><strong>I can read the format without Safari.</strong>\nAlthough
        Safari is only maintained by Apple, the Safari webarchive format can be read
        by non-Apple tools \u2013 it\u2019s a <a href=\"/til/2024/whats-inside-safari-webarchive/\">binary
        property list</a> that stores the raw bytes of the original files.\nI\u2019m
        comfortable that I\u2019ll be able to open these archives for a while, even
        if Safari unexpectedly goes away.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The one thing
        that\u2019s missing is a way to create webarchive files programatically.\nAlthough
        I could open each page and save it in Safari individually, I have about 6000\_bookmarks
        \u2013 I\u2019d like a way to automate this process.</p>\n\n<p>I was able
        to write a short script in Swift that does this for me.\nIn the rest of this
        article I\u2019ll explain how it works, or you can <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/safari-webarchiver/\">skip
        to the GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prior-art-newzealandpaulwebarchiver\">Prior
        art: newzealandpaul/webarchiver</h2>\n\n<p>I found an existing tool for creating
        Safari webarchives on the command line, <a href=\"https://github.com/newzealandpaul/webarchiver\">written
        by newzealandpaul</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I did some brief testing and it seems to
        work okay, but I had a few issues.\nThe error messages aren\u2019t very helpful
        \u2013 some of my bookmarks failed to save with an error like \u201Cinvalid
        URL\u201D, even though the URL opens just fine.\nI went to read the code to
        work out what was happening, but it\u2019s written in Objective\u2011C and
        uses deprecated classes like <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webview\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WebView</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webarchive\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WebArchive</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Given
        that it\u2019s only about 350\_lines, I wanted to see if I could rewrite it
        using Swift and the newest classes.\nI thought that might be easier than trying
        to understand a language and classes that I\u2019m not super familiar with.</p>\n\n<h2
        id=\"playing-with-wkwebview-and-createwebarchivedata\">Playing with <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code> and <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createWebArchiveData</code>\n</h2>\n\n<p>It
        didn\u2019t take much googling to learn that <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">WebView</code> has been replaced by <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code></a>, and that
        class has a method <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3650491-createwebarchivedata\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createWebArchiveData</code></a>
        which \u201Ccreates a web archive of the web view\u2019s current contents
        asynchronously\u201D.\nPerfect!</p>\n\n<p>I watched a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/\">WWDC
        session</a> by Brady Eison, a WebKit engineer, where the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">createWebArchiveData</code> API was introduced.\nIt gave
        me some useful context about the purpose of <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code> \u2013 it\u2019s for showing web content
        inside Mac and iOS apps.\nIf you\u2019ve ever used an in-app browser, there
        was probably an instance of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code>
        somewhere underneath.</p>\n\n<p>The session included some sample code for
        using this API, which I fashioned into an initial script:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span

        script did run, but it only created an empty file.</p>\n\n<p>I did a little
        debugging, and I realised that my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code>
        was never actually loading the web page.\nI pointed it at a local web server,
        and I could see it wasn\u2019t fetching any data.\nHmm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"we-need-a-loop-de-loop\">We
        need a loop-de-loop</h2>\n\n<p>Using a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code>
        inside a Swift script isn\u2019t how it\u2019s normally used.\nMost of the
        time, it appears as part of a web browser inside a Mac or iOS app.\nIn that
        context, you don\u2019t want fetching web pages to be a blocking operation
        \u2013 you want the rest of the app to remain responsive and usable, and download
        the web page as a background operation.</p>\n\n<p>This made me wonder if my
        problem was that my script doesn\u2019t have \u201Cbackground operations\u201D.\nWhen
        I ask <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code>
        to load my page, it\u2019s getting shoved in a queue of background tasks,
        but nothing is picking up work from that queue.\nI don\u2019t fully understand
        what I did next, but I think I\u2019ve got the gist of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I
        had another look at newzealandpaul\u2019s code, and I found <a href=\"https://github.com/newzealandpaul/webarchiver/blob/4d04669a9cb3f8a7e5ab492e7c3a4175b5586ac5/KBWebArchiver.m#L214-L222\">some
        lines</a> that look a bit like they\u2019re solving the same problem.\nI think
        the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NSRunLoop</code>
        is doing work that\u2019s on that background queue, and it\u2019s waiting
        until the page has finished loading:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-objectivec

        was able to adapt this idea for my Swift script, using <code class=\"language-plaintext

        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code> with
        the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">isLoading</code>
        attribute, so I kept running the main loop for short intervals until I could
        see this attribute change.\nI realised that <code class=\"language-plaintext

        that runs in the background, so I need to wait for that to finish too.</p>\n\n<p>I

        works, but there\u2019s a fairly glaring hole \u2013 it will archive whatever
        got loaded into the web view, even if the page wasn\u2019t loaded successfully.\nLet\u2019s
        fix that next.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"checking-the-page-loaded-successfully-with-wknavigationdelegate\">Checking
        the page loaded successfully with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKNavigationDelegate</code>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If
        there\u2019s some error getting the page \u2013 say, my Internet connection
        is down or the remote server doesn\u2019t respond \u2013 the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code> will still complete loading and set <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">isLoading = false</code>.\nMy
        code will then proceed to archive the error page, which is unhelpful.\nI\u2019d
        rather the script threw an error, and prompted me to investigate.</p>\n\n<p>While
        I was reading more about <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKWebView</code>,
        I came across the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WKNavigationDelegate</code></a>
        protocol.\nIf you implement this protocol, you can track the progress of a
        page load, and get detailed events like \u201Cthe page has started to load\u201D
        and \u201Cthe page failed to load with an error\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>There are
        <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate#2172386\">two
        methods</a> you can implement, which will be called if an error at different
        times during page load.\nBecause I\u2019m working in a standalone script,
        I just have them print an error and then terminate the process \u2013 I don\u2019t
        need more sophisticated error handling than that.</p>\n\n<p>I also wrote a
        method that checks the HTTP status code of the response, and terminates the
        script if it\u2019s not an HTTP\_200 OK.\nThis means that 404 pages and server
        errors won\u2019t be automatically archived \u2013 I can do that manually
        in Safari if I think they\u2019re really important.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s
        the delegate I wrote:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div

        remaining 15% are broken due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">link

        they all look good.</p>\n\n<p>My script worked correctly in the happy path,
        but I went back and improved some of the error messages.\nI saw a lot of different
        failures when archiving such a wide variety of URLs, including esoteric HTTP
        status codes, expired TLS certificates, and a couple of redirect loops.\nNow
        those errors are reported in a bit more detail and not just \u201Csomething
        went wrong\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>I also tweaked the code so it won\u2019t replace

        started writing a reply, but it was too long for Twitter, so I\u2019m posting
        it here.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever displaces AWS (and similar public clouds) as a
        dominant force in computing has to be significantly better in some key area.\nIt\u2019s
        not enough to offer a marginal improvement \u2013 \u201Clike AWS but 3% better\u201D
        isn\u2019t going to win anyone over.\nYou need some major advantage that provides
        the activation energy to justify the expense of switching away from AWS.</p>\n\n<p>This
        is why we see lots of stories of migrations between on-prem and public cloud,
        but not as many between different clouds.\nThere are major differences between
        on-prem and public cloud, and one of those differences might offer an advantage
        that justifies the cost of moving (in either direction).\nBut the big public
        clouds are similar enough that there are less advantages to switching between
        them.</p>\n\n<p>So what might be the big improvement that draws people away
        from AWS?\nHere are some guesses:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"turnkey-solutions-for-common-problems\">Turnkey
        solutions for common problems</h3>\n\n<p>AWS has <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/products/\">a
        <em>lot</em> of services</a>.\nThat flexibility is great, but it comes with
        challenges.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not always obvious which service is best for
        a given task, and a lot of common use cases require combining core primitives
        in architecture diagrams that resemble <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube
        Goldberg machines</a>.\nThese complex setups put a lot of responsibility on
        the developer to get everything right, and open the door to subtle bugs.\nFor
        example, setting up your IAM permissions so services can talk to each other
        is quite fiddly, and it\u2019s tempting to write a blanket \u201Callow all\u201D
        policy and be done with it.</p>\n\n<p>I think there\u2019s an opportunity
        for higher-level services that streamline this experience.\nCombine these
        core primitives and present a nicer interface for common use cases \u2013
        static sites, web apps, data pipelines.\nDevelopers give up some flexibility,
        but in return they get a simpler workflow, better guard rails, and the peace
        of mind that they haven\u2019t left a ticking time bomb somewhere in their
        config.</p>\n\n<p>I already see some services in this area \u2013 Vercel,
        Glitch, and Netlify spring to mind \u2013 and I\u2019m sure there more.\nThey
        won\u2019t replace all use of AWS, and they\u2019re not trying to, but I think
        they can carve off big chunks if they\u2019re lucky.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"closer-to-the-edge\">Closer
        to the Edge</h3>\n\n<p>There are lots of advantages to running your code close
        to users \u2013 as in, geographically close.\nAt some point all our devices
        are powerful enough that the network speed is the bottleneck for an app, and
        over long enough distances geographic latency becomes an issue.</p>\n\n<p>AWS
        is still very tied to the \u201Cregion\u201D model \u2013 your code runs in
        data centres in a specific geographic location.\nA lot of requests still need
        to be routed back to that location before they can be handled, even if that\u2019s
        halfway round the world.\nIt\u2019s non-trivial to run your app across multiple
        regions.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few AWS services that have a global presence,
        like CloudFront and CloudFront Functions, but there are other platforms that
        run in the edge by default, not tied to specific locations.\nIf this becomes
        more important, I think AWS might struggle to catch up compared to newer players.</p>\n\n<p>I
        wrote those three paragraphs in January 2022, long before the current wave
        of generative AI and Large Language Models arrived.\nAt the time I thought
        there might be applications that would benefit from running in an edge network,
        but I wasn\u2019t sure what they were.\nI wonder if AI and LLMs will be those
        applications \u2013 they\u2019re definitely trying to be as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I
        haven\u2019t followed the field closely, but it feels like LLM latency is
        still defined by the speed of the model rather than the network connection.\nEven
        if you\u2019re running a model locally, you\u2019re still waiting multiple
        seconds for results.\nHow long will that last?\nHow long before models are
        fast enough that there\u2019s a perceptible benefit to running them close
        to your users?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"more-presence-in-the-global-south\">More presence
        in the Global South</h3>\n\n<p>Like a lot of the tech industry, AWS is very
        US-centric.\nThere are <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\">more
        AWS regions on the west coast of the USA</a> than in all of South America
        and Africa.\nBut there are a lot of users and developers in the rest of the
        world, and it feels like they\u2019re underserved by a tech industry which
        is based in the Global North.\n(Which assumes, for example, reliable access
        to cutting-edge hardware and high-bandwidth Internet connections as standard.)</p>\n\n<p>I
        wonder what infrastructure that envisions the Global South as your primary
        users would look like.\nWhat if Silicon Valley isn\u2019t the centre of your
        universe?\nIs it just the same AWS, but at a lower latitude?\nOr are there
        meaningful differences in how you build services for people who live in that
        part of the world?</p>\n\n<p>(This is only a vague thought because I\u2019m
        not an expert on politics, socioeconomics, or the tech industry in the Global
        South.\nI don\u2019t know what might happen here, but I suspect it\u2019s
        not nothing.)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-free-tier-thats-actually-free\">A Free Tier
        that\u2019s actually free</h3>\n\n<p>There are plenty of horror stories about
        devs who set up an account on the so-called \u201CFree Tier\u201D, and then
        receive a life-ruining bill.\nEven if AWS forgives those charges, it has a
        chilling effect and deters people from trying the platform.\n(I don\u2019t
        have a personal AWS account for precisely this reason.)</p>\n\n<p>The free
        tier isn\u2019t about making money \u2013 it\u2019s about cultivating a community
        of users who are experienced and comfortable with your platform.\nWhen those
        users later have money to spend, you hope they\u2019ll pick you as the thing
        they already know.\nBut that can\u2019t happen if they\u2019re scared off
        before they can try the free tier.</p>\n\n<p>Making a better free tier is
        a long-term play for a competitor, and risky \u2013 you have to survive long
        enough for your free tier users to become paying customers.\nBut I think it
        could work, and you could win some business by speaking to people who aren\u2019t
        CTOs yet, but will be in a couple of years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"better-bills-for-big-business\">Better
        bills for big business</h3>\n\n<p>Individual users want to get the most bang
        for their buck; companies have different priorities.\nThey want something
        that\u2019s predictable, which can fit in their accounting spreadsheets.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s
        really hard to predict your AWS bill, because it follows a \u201Cpay-as-you-go\u201D
        model and you can use different amounts each month.\nAt my last job, we\u2019d
        routinely see a 5\u201310% change in our month-to-month bill.\nThat wasn\u2019t
        a big issue for us, but it could be an issue for somebody trying to do plan
        tight budgets or estimate future spending.</p>\n\n<p>Even when you get the
        bill, it can be hard to understand where the money is going.\nThere are consultancies
        whose sole purpose is helping companies understand the cryptic crossword that
        is an AWS billing statement.</p>\n\n<p>Predictable and comprehensible billing
        feels like it would be appealing to a lot of businesses.\nI don\u2019t think
        it\u2019d be the sole reason to switch to a competitor, but it would sweeten
        the deal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-power-of-politics\">The power of politics</h3>\n\n<p>Public
        sentiment towards big tech companies is changing, and not in a positive way.\nI
        can imagine new legislation that would hamstring AWS and other big public
        clouds, and drive a shift towards a larger set of small clouds, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>Concerns about the environmental impact of large data centres might
        lead to restrictions on their construction or expansion.</li>\n  <li>Antitrust
        or anti-monopoly lawsuits might force AWS to make changes which make their
        product worse, and leave an opening for a competitor.</li>\n  <li>More data
        locality laws that force companies to keep data inside national boundaries
        could lock AWS out of certain contracts, and drive business towards smaller,
        local clouds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know how likely any of these
        are, but they seem more plausible now than they did, say, five years ago.\nI
        can imagine a future where AWS comes under more political scrutiny.</p>\n\n<h3
        id=\"or-maybe-something-completely-different\">Or maybe something completely
        different</h3>\n\n<p>Take all this with a pinch of salt.\nI\u2019m no expert,
        and this is light-hearted speculation rather than in-depth analysis.</p>\n\n<p>When
        a company comes along that displaces AWS, it could do all of these, or none
        of them.\nThere are plenty of other strategies that smarter people than me
        have thought of.</p>\n\n<p>I do think it\u2019s \u201Cwhen\u201D, not \u201Cif\u201D.\nWe
        may think of AWS as an institution now, but one day it will be relegated to
        the likes of IBM and Oracle \u2013 tech companies that still exist, but with
        a fraction of the power and influence they had at their zenith.\nThe bigger
        a company gets, the more work it takes to change direction \u2013 and eventually
        a smaller, more agile competitor will replace you.</p>\n\n<p>At a previous
        job I was designing a digital archive that was stored in AWS, and that archive
        is expected to last decades, if not centuries.\nThat\u2019s why I was thinking
        about the long-term future of AWS \u2013 that archive probably will outlast
        public cloud as a dominant model, and we designed the archive to make it easy
        to exit when that day comes.\nThis article has sat in my drafts for years,
        and I\u2019m glad James\u2019s tweet finally prompted me to finish it.</p>\n\n<p>I
        don\u2019t think AWS is going away any time soon, and if you\u2019re not an
        Amazon executive you probably don\u2019t need to think about it.\nWe should
        all be more concerned with our own longevity, not AWS.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If

        there were local elections in the UK, and this morning I\u2019ve been catching
        up on the news.\nAs I was reading Yohannes Lowe\u2019s live coverage in the
        Guardian, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/may/02/local-elections-2024-latest-results-live-tory-conservative-labour-lib-dem-green-south-blackpool-mayor-london-west-midlands-tees-valley?page=with:block-6633f9e98f08715725f7b79e#block-6633f9e98f08715725f7b79e\">spotted
        a word I didn\u2019t recognise</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Labour and the Conservatives are each defending about 1,000 seats, and
        <em>psephologists</em> predict that the Tories may lose about 500.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A
        quick trip to Google cleared up my initial confusion: psephologists are experts
        in <em>psephology</em>, which is the scientific study of elections and voting
        behaviour.\nThey analyse data from past elections, study voting behaviour,
        and try to forecast the result of future elections.\nI\u2019ve seen experts
        do this sort of analysis in news coverage of elections, but I never knew there
        was a word for it!</p>\n\n<p>I could have guessed the definition of \u201Cpsephologist\u201D
        from the context, but not if I saw it in isolation.\nAlthough I recognise
        the <em>-ology</em> suffix as \u201Cthe study of something\u201D, I didn\u2019t
        recognise the <em>pseph-</em> prefix at all, and I was curious where it came
        from.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"voting-and-counting-in-ancient-greece\">Voting and counting
        in ancient Greece</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephology\">Wikipedia
        article</a> for psephology explains that <em>pseph-</em> comes from the Greek
        word for pebble, because pebbles were used for voting in ancient Greece.\nIt
        refers to <a href=\"https://www.getty.edu/news/voting-with-the-ancient-greeks/\">an
        article by Annelisa Stephan</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Voting with pebbles?
        Even allowing for artistic license, it seems the Greeks really did it this
        way. Voters deposited a pebble into one of two urns to mark their choice;
        after voting, the urns were emptied onto counting boards for tabulation. [\u2026]
        In ancient Greece a pebble was called a <em>psephos</em>, which gives us the
        dubious term psephology, the scientific study of elections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I
        also found a paper by Alan Boegehold <a href=\"https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/147360.pdf\"><em>Towards
        a Study of Athenian Voting Procedure</em></a>, which describes the use of
        pebbles when counting votes in ancient Greece.\nIt talks about voting using
        special bronze discs as ballots, and various mechanisms for keeping ballots
        secret.</p>\n\n<p>This includes an early example of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud#Ballot_stuffing\">ballot
        stuffing</a>, when \u201Cthirty men somehow dropped a total of more than sixty
        ballots into [the urn]\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>He also describes a scene from Greek
        vase paintings, in which men cast votes for Ajax and Odysseus using piles
        of pebbles.\nOne notable aspect is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any
        secrecy involved in the voting \u2013 we can see who two of the men are voting
        for.</p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"vases\">\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103W7A?altImage=458e6e84-6c86-4b76-835a-670cfb3f416f\"><picture>

        down to put a pebble on one of the piles and cast his vote.\" width=\"700\">

        (or altar?) which men approach from right and left. They are about to vote;
        two, in fact, are in the act of voting. That the others have already voted
        is clear from the two small piles of pebbles on the altar. The pebbles to
        the left appear to be about double the number of those on the right. They
        represent votes cast for Odysseus, the victor, while those to the right, fewer,
        have been cast for Ajax. The two heroes themselves appear at the extreme right
        and left. Athena, gesturing gracefully with her right hand, certifies Odysseus'
        victory, although the voting is not yet over.\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>This
        feels familiar from modern politics, where the result of an election is often
        known before the counting is complete.\n(Sorry Ajax.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"its-not-just-for-voting\">It\u2019s
        not just for voting</h2>\n\n<p>Boegehold also describes the use of pebbles
        as a way to count things other than votes, when fingers were insufficient.\nMostly
        he\u2019s talking about ancient Greece, but he also mentions pebbles being
        sealed inside clay tablets as a form of bookkeeping in Mesopotamia.\nThey
        were placed inside a tablet with an inscription of a sheep (or goat), and
        the pebbles counted the animals involved.</p>\n\n<p>I came across a similar
        idea last year while reading <em>It All Adds Up</em>, by Micka\xEBl Launay.\nI
        forget the exact time period, but it was early in human civilisation when
        writing was still uncommon.\nSomebody owns a flock of sheep, and they send
        a shepherd out to tend them during the day.\nThey want to know the same number
        of sheep came back \u2013 how do they count them?</p>\n\n<p>They came up with
        a series of tokens, each with a picture of a sheep.\nYou put them in a jar,
        and count them to match the sheep who came back.\nBut does the shepherd trust
        the owner?\nHow do they know the owner won\u2019t add tokens?</p>\n\n<p>So
        they\u2019d put the tokens in a sealed spherical jar, and both of them would
        sign it.\nBut how do you know the size of the flock without opening the jar?\nThey\u2019d
        put marks on the side to count the size \u2013 but now why do you need the
        tokens in the jar at all?</p>\n\n<p>This is an early versions of numbers on
        \u201Cpaper\u201D, a more abstract form of counting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-uses-of-the-pseph--prefix\">Other
        uses of the <em>pseph-</em> prefix</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019d never heard of the
        Greek word <em>psephos</em>; the closest I knew was <em>lithos</em>, for stone.\nI
        know lots of English words that use <em>litho-</em> as a root, my favourite
        being the somewhat whimsical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithobraking\"><em>lithobraking</em></a>.\n(Stopping
        your spaceship by ploughing it into a rock.)</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, there
        only seem to be less English words <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greek_and_Latin_roots_in_English/P#pseph-\">that
        use <em>pseph-</em> as a root</a>, and I don\u2019t recognise any of them.\nTwo
        of the words suggested by Wikipedia are literally about pebbles (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephite\"><em>psephite</em></a>/<em>psephitic</em>
        describes sediment made of pebble-sized fragments), and a third is about their
        use in counting (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopsephy\"><em>isopsephy</em></a>
        is adding up the number values of the letters to get a single number).</p>\n\n<p>I
        was a bit confused by isopsephy initially, but it makes more sense after reading
        about how pebbles were a tool for counting lots of things, not just votes.\nThat
        looks like it could be a fun Wikipedia rabbit hole about word counting methods
        that are a bit like Scrabble, including a similar Hebrew practice called <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria\"><em>gematria</em></a>, but
        I really have to stop now.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post

        type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2024/scheduled-screenshots/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>A
        few weeks ago I was reading the <a href=\"https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/champion-digital-preservation/bit-list\"><abbr
        title=\"Digital Preservation Coalition\">DPC</abbr> Bit List</a>, an inventory
        of digital materials and the risks associated with their long-term preservation.\nWhat
        formats need urgent attention before they\u2019re lost forever, what mediums
        are already being well-preserved, and so on.\nFor example, Adobe Flash animations
        are \u201Cpractically extinct\u201D, while emails are merely \u201Cendangered\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>Something
        that struck me is how the Bit List treats the content and interface of online
        services as two separate concerns.\nMost preservation efforts focus on saving
        the <em>content</em> \u2013 the photos, videos, and text that we upload to
        the web.\nWe don\u2019t have as many records of the <em>interfaces</em> \u2013
        the \u201Clook and feel\u201D of these sites.\nBut if you only save one and
        not the other, you\u2019re losing a lot of important context about how we
        use those sites, and the influence of their designs.</p>\n\n<p>One present-day
        example is TikTok.\nIt popularised the use of vertical swiping to move between
        videos, and that design makes it easy for users to watch a continuous stream
        of content.\nIt\u2019s very effective at keeping people in the app, and it\u2019s
        been copied by lots of other services.\nAlthough it seems well-known and obvious
        to us today, it\u2019ll be easy to forget the novelty and impact of this idea
        as social media continues to evolve.</p>\n\n<p>This user interface is behind
        concerns about the addictive nature of TikTok, because it requires minimal
        effort to stay in the app and watch another video.\nIt\u2019s also affected
        how videos are made, because creators need to capture your attention quickly
        before you swipe to watch something else.\nPopular videos on TikTok look different
        to those on YouTube, on television, or in cinema.</p>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t
        understand TikTok or its effect on the world without understanding this interface.\nWatching
        a single TikTok video in an isolated player isn\u2019t the same as experiencing
        it in the app.</p>\n\n<p>This distinction between content and interfaces got
        me thinking about how you preserve user interfaces.\nOne challenge is that
        most user interfaces don\u2019t have a single version.\nDesigns are constantly
        changing as companies add features, fix bugs, and try to find new ways to
        get more of our attention.\nEven if you put aside the technical issues, we
        can only really preserve snapshots of how a service looked at a particular
        point in time.</p>\n\n<p>One way to create these snapshots is with <a href=\"/2022/screenshots/\">screenshots
        or screen recordings</a>.\nI think they represent a good tradeoff of effort
        and preservation value.\nA static screenshot isn\u2019t as complete as a fully
        interactive, working copy of a thing, but it\u2019s much easier to create,
        to preserve, and to access later.\nIt records the look, if not the feel.</p>\n\n<p>I
        was mulling over this for a while, and I had an idea.\nI like having a set
        of screenshots as a visual history of the stuff I\u2019ve worked on (including
        this site), but I\u2019m not very good at remembering to create them.\nI just
        finished a bunch of design tweaking on this site, and I completely forgot
        to take a screenshot of what it looked like before I started making changes.</p>\n\n<p>Computers
        are pretty good at doing things on a repetitive schedule \u2013 wouldn\u2019t
        it be nice if I could automate taking these screenshots?\nWhat if a computer
        took a screenshot of my website every month?\nOr every week?\nOr every day?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I
        already had a vague idea of how to take screenshots programatically.\nAt my
        last job we used <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a> as a way
        to do end-to-end testing of our websites.\nPlaywright is a library for automating
        web browsers \u2013 for example, you can use it to open a website in Chromium,
        click buttons, check the page loads correctly, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>It can
        also take a screenshot of a web page, like so:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>npm <span class=\"nb\">install
        </span>playwright\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>npx
        playwright <span class=\"nb\">install </span>chromium\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span>npx playwright screenshot <span class=\"nt\">--full-page</span>
        <span class=\"s2\">\"alexwlchan.net\"</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"screenshot.png\"</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This
        installs Playwright, then opens my website in Chromium and takes a screenshot
        of the page.\nThe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--full-page</code>
        flag ensures the image contains the entire scrollable page, as if you had
        a tall screen and could fit the whole page in view without scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>Once
        I knew how to take a screenshot once, I wanted to do it on a regular schedule,
        and save those images somewhere.\nThere are lots of ways to run code on a
        schedule; I decided to use <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub
        Actions</a> because it\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>My code
        for taking scheduled screenshots is entirely contained in a single GitHub
        Actions workflow.\nIt\u2019s in a file called <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scheduled-screenshots/blob/a5c836cfcc6a3729fe53db97b34d116949fba377/.github/workflows/take_screenshots.yml\"><code

        mornings \u2013 I don\u2019t update my websites that often, so I don\u2019t
        need more frequent screenshots.</p>\n\n<p>It installs Playwright, and uses
        it to take screenshots of two websites: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">alexwlchan.net</code>
        (this site) and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">books.alexwlchan.net</code>
        (my book tracker).\nThe images are saved in a folder called <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">screenshots</code>, and the filenames include both the
        name of the site and the date taken, e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">alexwlchan.net.2024-04-22.png</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">books.2024-03-21.png</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If I want to get
        screenshots of a different website, I can add to the list in the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">matrix</code> section.</p>\n\n<p>I had to add a timeout
        to Playwright (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--wait-for-timeout
        10000</code>) to ensure it downloads all the images correctly.\nBefore I added
        that option, I\u2019d sometimes get screenshots with holes where the images
        hadn\u2019t loaded in time.</p>\n\n<p>Once the screenshot has been created,
        it gets committed to Git and pushed to GitHub.\nI had to tweak the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions\">GITHUB_TOKEN
        permissions</a> to allow GitHub Actions to push commits to my repo.\nThis
        is inspired by Simon Willison\u2019s <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/\">\u201Cgit
        scraping\u201D technique</a>, but I\u2019m tracking images rather than text.</p>\n\n<p>Because
        PNG files can get quite big and I have a lot of them, I decided to use <a
        href=\"https://git-lfs.com/\">Git Large File Storage (LFS)</a> with this repo
        \u2013 vanilla Git can struggle with large binary files.\nThis is my first
        time using Git\_LFS, and it was pleasantly easy to set up following the <a
        href=\"https://git-lfs.com/\">Getting Started guide</a>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>brew <span class=\"nb\">install
        </span>git-lfs\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>git lfs
        <span class=\"nb\">install</span>\n<span class=\"go\">\n</span><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">cd</span> ~/repos/scheduled-screenshots\n<span
        class=\"go\">\n</span><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>git
        lfs track <span class=\"s2\">\"*.png\"</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span>git add .gitattributes\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span>git commit <span class=\"nt\">-m</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Add
        .gitattributes file to store PNG images in Git\_LFS\"</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And
        that\u2019s what it took to set up scheduled screenshots.\nIf you want to
        see the code in a repo, or see the growing collection of screenshots, the
        GitHub repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scheduled-screenshots\">alexwlchan/scheduled-screenshots</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This
        is great for creating new screenshots, but what about everything that came
        before?\nThis site is nearly 12 years old, and it\u2019d be nice for that
        to be reflected in the visual record.</p>\n\n<p>I dove into the Wayback Machine
        to backfill the old screenshots.\nMy site isn\u2019t indexed that often \u2013
        on average about once a month \u2013 but I can fill in some of the gaps this
        way.\nFirst I used the Wayback Machine\u2019s <a href=\"/til/2024/get-a-list-of-captures-from-the-wayback-machine/\">CDX
        Server API</a> to get a list of captures, then I <a href=\"/til/2024/take-a-wayback-machine-screenshot/\">used
        Playwright</a> to take screenshots.\nI had to adjust the timeouts to make
        sure everything loaded correctly, but I got them all to work eventually, and
        I got a hundred or so historical screenshots.</p>\n\n<p>I was surprised by
        was how many issues I found.\nThere were 116 captures of <a href=\"https://books.alexwlchan.net/\">my
        book tracker</a>, and of those 13 were clearly broken \u2013 the CSS or images
        hadn\u2019t been saved, and so the page was unstyled or had gaps where the
        images were meant to go.</p>\n\n<p>A further 7 were broken in subtle ways,
        where the HTML and CSS didn\u2019t match.\nFor example, I found one HTML capture
        <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210625222812/https://books.alexwlchan.net/\">from
        2021</a> that\u2019s loading CSS from 2024.\nThe Wayback Machine shows you
        a working page, but it\u2019s a hallucination \u2013 that\u2019s not what
        the page looked like in 2021.\n(The rounded corners are a dead giveaway \u2013
        I didn\u2019t add those until 2022.)</p>\n\n<p>I love the Wayback Machine
        and I think it\u2019s a great service, but you shouldn\u2019t rely on it to
        preserve your website.\nI\u2019m glad these captures exist exist, but they\u2019re
        a bit shaky as a preservation record.\nIf there\u2019s a website you care
        about, make sure you have your own system that saves the stuff you think is
        important \u2013 don\u2019t just rely on the Wayback Machine.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<picture>\n

        and every Monday I\u2019ll get a new image to record the visual history of
        this site.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to set up something similar for your websites,
        here are the steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create a new GitHub repository</li>\n
        \ <li>Create a new file <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.github/workflows/take_screenshots.yml</code>
        with the contents of the YAML file earlier in this post</li>\n  <li>Give <a
        href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions\">write
        access</a> to the GITHUB_TOKEN used by GitHub Actions, so it can push to your
        repo</li>\n  <li>Change the list of URLs/filename prefixes in the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">matrix</code> block for the websites you want to screenshot</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The
        best time to start taking regular screenshots of my website was when I registered
        the domain name.\nThe second best time is now.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2024/jekyll-caching/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>This
        website is a static site built with <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>,
        and recently I overhauled the process for generating the site.\nThis should
        be invisible if you\u2019re just a reader, but it makes a big difference to
        me \u2013 like any software project, I\u2019d accumulated cruft and complexity,
        and it was time to sweep that all away.\nThe new process is simpler and should
        be easier to debug when stuff breaks.\nYay!</p>\n\n<p>One of my goals was
        making the site faster to build.\nThis site is pretty small, modern computers
        are silly fast, and yet I was still waiting at least a minute for builds with
        a warm cache.\nI was sure it could be faster!\nSo I tried to find ways to
        speed up the build process.</p>\n\n<p>I found two bits of low-hanging fruit
        that could be useful additions to a lot of Jekyll sites.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-the-jekyll-cache-api\">Use
        the Jekyll Cache API</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/alexwlchan.net/tree/9e6a7db8ace9066fab09886e6bafa6b86c41ed4f/src/_plugins\">quite
        a few Jekyll plugins</a> which I keep in my <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">_plugins</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these are various
        text processing functions that always return the same output for the same
        input.\nFor example, I have one plugin that <a href=\"/2020/adding-non-breaking-spaces-with-jekyll/\">adds
        non-breaking spaces</a> to my rendered HTML, and it always adds the same set
        of spaces.</p>\n\n<p>This makes my plugins a good fit for Jekyll 4\u2019s
        <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/cache-api/\">caching API</a>, which
        allows me to cache the expensive computation in my plugins.\nThe API is quite
        nice: you create an instance of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Jekyll::Cache</code>,
        then you call <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getset(key)</code>.\nIf
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">key</code> is already
        in the cache, it returns the cached value; if not, it runs the expensive computation
        once and stores the value in the cache.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-ruby highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">cache</span>\n  <span class=\"vc\">@@cache</span>
        <span class=\"o\">||=</span> <span class=\"no\">Jekyll</span><span class=\"o\">::</span><span
        class=\"no\">Cache</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">new</span><span
        class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'AddNonBreakingSpaces'</span><span
        class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">end</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span>
        <span class=\"nf\">add_non_breaking_spaces</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span
        class=\"n\">markdown</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">cache</span><span
        class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getset</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span
        class=\"n\">markdown</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n
        \   <span class=\"n\">expensive_add_non_breaking_spaces_method</span><span
        class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">markdown</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n
        \ <span class=\"k\">end</span>\n<span class=\"k\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>In
        this code, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">expensive_add_non_breaking_spaces_method</code>
        will only be called once, and then cached until the Markdown changes or the
        cache is cleared.</p>\n\n<p>The cache is cleared every time you change <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">_config.yml</code> or you run
        Jekyll with a different verb, e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">build</code>
        or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">serve</code>.\nThis
        makes it easy to see the impact that caching is having \u2013 make a change
        to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">_config.yml</code>,
        then run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jekyll build</code>
        twice.\nThe first build will run with a cold cache, the second with a warm
        cache.\nThe difference is the speedup you get from caching.</p>\n\n<p>In this
        site, adding caching to my plugins speeds up the build from ~6s to ~1.5s.\nThat\u2019s
        4\xD7 faster!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"add-caching-to-the-built-in-jekyll-filters\">Add
        caching to the built-in Jekyll filters</h2>\n\n<p>I did some testing with
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jekyll build --profile</code>
        to find which pages were taking the most build time, and I discovered that
        the built-in <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/#smartify\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code> filter</a>
        was taking a big chunk of the build time.\nThis is a filter which converts
        \"straight quotes\" into \u201Ccurly quotes\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>I use this filter
        in a lot of places (individual posts, index pages, the RSS feed) and it\u2019s
        another good fit for the caching API \u2013 adding curly quotes to a piece
        of text will always return the same result.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways you
        could add caching to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code>
        filter:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>create a new filter <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">cached_smartify</code>, and use that instead of <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code>\n</li>\n  <li>override
        the existing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code>
        filter to add caching</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think both approaches are fine,
        and it just depends on which style you prefer.\nIn this case, I slightly prefer
        the second approach, so I added a \u201Ccached smartify\u201D plugin to my
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">_plugins</code> folder.\nThis
        overrides the existing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code>
        filter and replaces it with a cached version.\nI can continue to use <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">smartify</code> in my templates
        as before, and enjoy a nice speedup:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-ruby highlighter-rouge\"><div

        last time I refactored the site build, it felt pretty fast.\nOver time, I\u2019ve
        gradually made changes that slowed it down, and it was feeling pretty sluggish.\nI
        didn\u2019t think to record precise timings before I started the refactor,
        but I know I sometimes had to wait tens of seconds for a build to run.</p>\n\n<p>Now
        this site takes ~1.5s to build (with a warm cache).\nIt doesn\u2019t exactly
        feel \u201Cfast\u201D, but it doesn\u2019t feel slow any more.\nI\u2019m sure
        I could wring out more speed if I really tried, but this is already a big
        improvement and fast enough for now.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the improvements came
        from simplifying the build system, and deleting a bunch of custom code that
        was causing slowness.\nThe Jekyll caching is only part of the speedup, but
        it\u2019s the improvement most likely to be applicable to other Jekyll sites.</p>\n\n<p>When
        the site is slow, I get frustrated, bored, and tend to find excuses not to
        write anything.\nWhen the site is fast, I enjoy working on it and I\u2019m
        more likely to write new stuff.\nOne of my goals for this year is to spend
        more time on my writing, and making it more pleasant to write is a good step
        in that direction.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd

        an hour or so, Hannah Waddingham will take the stage at the Royal Albert Hall,
        and present this year\u2019s Olivier Awards.\nI won\u2019t be there, but a
        number of dear friends are in the audience, and we\u2019re keeping our fingers
        crossed for <em>Operation Mincemeat</em> \u2013 a musical with which we all
        have an entirely normal and healthy relationship.\n(Just don\u2019t ask how
        many times we\u2019ve been.)</p>\n\n<p>One of <em>Mincemeat</em>\u2019s six
        nominations is \u201COutstanding musical contribution\u201D, specifically
        Joe Bunker for music directing and Steve Sidwell for orchestrating.\nWhile
        we wait to find out who\u2019s won, I wanted to point out a fun detail in
        the music \u2013 one that I only heard for myself last night.</p>\n\n<p>In
        the second act, the main characters are waiting for news of a fake plane crash
        \u2013 a dead body they\u2019ve dressed to look like the made-up British officer
        William Martin, who\u2019s carrying \u201Csecret plans\u201D about the \u201CAllied
        invasion of Europe\u201D.\nThe idea is that he\u2019ll wash ashore in Spain,
        the Germans will find the plans in his briefcase, and they\u2019ll be misled
        about the Allies\u2019s true goals.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately the initial news
        is quite different \u2013 an Allied pilot has washed ashore, but he\u2019s
        very much alive and very much American.\nWe get to know him in the song <em>The
        Ballad of Willie Watkins</em>, while the main characters fret about whether
        two pilots crashing on the same day, in the same place, with the same name,
        might arouse suspicion.</p>\n\n<p>(This may seem like an implausible coincidence,
        but it\u2019s true.\nWillie Watkins was a real pilot, he really did crash
        in Spain, and he was even present at William Martin\u2019s autopsy \u2013
        a detail <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spitlip/status/1667667754940235778\">too
        ridiculous to fit into the show</a>.\nTruth is stranger than fiction.)</p>\n\n<p>For
        months now, friends have been telling me that <em>The Ballad of Willie Watkins</em>
        has a few bars from <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em>, the US national anthem,
        but I\u2019ve always struggled to hear it.\nWith some help from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeLiam3\">Liam
        in the Discord</a>, I was able to spot it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a clip
        from the cast recording where the anthem is playing in the background:</p>\n\n<figure>\n
        \ <audio src=\"/files/2024/Star_Spangled_Willie_Watkins_original.mp3\"></audio>\n

        MP3</a>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Liam messed with an EQ to make the
        <em>Star-Spangled Banner</em> a bit more prominent \u2013 the rest of the
        song fades away when the anthem is playing.\nHere\u2019s an MP3 he made:</p>\n\n<figure>\n
        \ <audio src=\"/files/2024/Star_Spangled_Willie_Watkins.mp3\"></audio>\n  <figcaption>\n
        \   <a href=\"/files/2024/Star_Spangled_Willie_Watkins.mp3\">Download MP3</a>\n
        \ </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>I took that a step further by stripping out
        the bass and the drums, and I think it makes those parts even more prominent.\n(I
        googled something like \u201Cremove lyrics from MP3\u201D and used the first
        website I found.\nIt split the MP3 into different tracks, and I could toggle
        each of them off/on.)\nThis makes it very clear to me:</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <audio
        src=\"/files/2024/Star_Spangled_Willie_Watkins_music.mp3\"></audio>\n  <figcaption>\n
        \   <a href=\"/files/2024/Star_Spangled_Willie_Watkins_music.mp3\">Download
        MP3</a>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>These processed versions definitely
        distort the brass which is actually playing the melody, but they were enough
        that I can now reliably hear it in the unprocessed soundtrack.\nAnd last night,
        I was sitting in the audience and I finally heard the <em>Star-Spangled Banner</em>
        as it was played live!</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2024/flapi/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>I
        use <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/services/api/\">the Flickr API</a> pretty
        much every day in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.org/\">my day job</a>.\nWithin
        the first week, I bashed together a couple of command-line tools to make a
        simple tool for exploring the API.\nThey\u2019re not meant for building \u201Cproper\u201D
        apps, more for quick experiments and seeing what API responses look like.</p>\n\n<p>The
        main tool is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flapi</code>,
        and you pass it two arguments: the name of the API method, and (optionally)
        any query parameters you want to include.\nThen it calls the Flickr API for
        you!</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span>flapi flickr.photos.getInfo photo_id=25260341744\n<span
        class=\"go\">&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;</span><span
        class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"go\">&lt;rsp stat=\"ok\"&gt;</span><span
        class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"go\">  &lt;photo id=\"25260341744\" secret=\"3e30df4a20\"
        server=\"1645\" farm=\"2\" dateuploaded=\"1458345230\" isfavorite=\"0\" license=\"7\"
        safety_level=\"0\" rotation=\"0\" originalsecret=\"b473e4a3b0\" originalformat=\"jpg\"
        views=\"83654\" media=\"photo\"&gt;</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span
        class=\"go\">    \u2026\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>There are
        lots of ways to play with APIs \u2013 colleagues at a previous job used Postman,
        and Flickr itself has an API Explorer where you can try requests in the browser.\nI
        like doing it with a command-line tool because I always have lots of terminal
        windows open, and it\u2019s easy to grab one and check something with <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flapi</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Today
        I finally took the time to tidy up the script <a href=\"https://github.com/Flickr-Foundation/flapi.sh\">and
        post it on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The code isn\u2019t complicated \u2013 indeed,
        it was easy to cobble it together from a bunch of other tools.\nEven if you
        have no interest in the Flickr API, some of them might be useful for you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>I\u2019m using <a href=\"https://github.com/jaraco/keyring\">keyring</a>
        to store and retrieve my Flickr API key in the macOS Keychain.\nThis is a
        Python library that makes it easy to manage passwords and other secrets, and
        to avoid hard-coding secrets in my code.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>I use
        <a href=\"https://curl.se/\">curl</a> to make the actual HTTP request.\nI
        recently listened to an <a href=\"https://github.com/readme/podcast/curl-25-years\">interesting
        interview</a> with Daniel Stenberg, curl\u2019s creator and maintainer, where
        he talked about how curl got started and how he keeps it going.</p>\n  </li>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>I pipe the output to <a href=\"https://opensource.apple.com/source/libxml2/libxml2-7/libxml2/doc/xmllint.html\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">xmllint --format</code></a>,
        which pretty-prints the XML.\nI\u2019m not sure how much of a difference it
        makes to Flickr\u2019s API responses, but it\u2019s nice to remember that
        macOS has a built in reformatter for XML.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Finally,
        I pipe the reformatted XML to <a href=\"https://pygments.org/\">Pygments</a>
        to add syntax highlighting.\nFor me, this makes the output a bit easier to
        read.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Put together, the core logic of <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">flapi</code> is just four lines:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"nv\">api_key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"si\">$(</span>keyring
        get flickr_api key<span class=\"si\">)</span>\n\ncurl <span class=\"nt\">--silent</span>
        <span class=\"s2\">\"https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?api_key=</span><span
        class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">api_key</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span
        class=\"s2\">&amp;method=</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">method</span><span
        class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span
        class=\"nv\">params</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span>
        <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n  | xmllint <span class=\"nt\">--format</span>
        - <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n  | pygmentize <span class=\"nt\">-l</span>
        xml\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>These four programs feel like an exemplar
        of the Unix Way: small tools that each do one task well, written so they can
        be combined in complex ways.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post

        of the things I\u2019ve been working on at the Flickr Foundation is a new
        \u201CCommons Explorer\u201D, a way to browse the photos in the Flickr Commons.</p>\n\n<p>Flickr
        Commons is a collection of historical photography from cultural institutions
        from all around the world, all with no known copyright restrictions.\nIt started
        with the Library of Congress in 2008, and now includes over 100 institutions
        from 24 different countries.</p>\n\n<p>One of the cool things about Flickr
        Commons is the variety of photos, and I enjoy looking \u201Cacross\u201D the
        Commons.\nI used a lot of Commons photos in my <a href=\"/2024/step-step-step/\">Monki\_Gras
        talk</a> last month, and I had fun using the <a href=\"https://commons.flickr.org/search?query=dance\">new
        search</a> to find dance-related photos from all the different members.</p>\n\n<p>The
        <a href=\"https://commons.flickr.org/\">Commons Explorer</a> is a new tool
        that encourages this sort of cross-collection exploration.\nIt tries to treat
        the Flickr Commons as a single collection of photographs, and to provide interesting
        views into the data that are more than just traditional search.\nThere are
        lots of cool photos to find!</p>\n\n<p>You can try the new Commons Explorer
        at <a href=\"https://commons.flickr.org\">commons.flickr.org</a>, or you can

        be thinking about the event for weeks to come, and there\u2019s still another
        day to go!</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m pleased with the talk I wrote, and people seemed
        to enjoy it.\nThe talk wasn\u2019t recorded, but I\u2019ve put my slides and
        notes below.\n(I wanted to get these up quickly, so there may be silly typos
        or mistakes.\nPlease let me know if you see any!)</p>\n\n<p>This is the key
        message: <em>being a good user of AI is about both technical skills and managing
        your trust in the tool</em>.\nYou need to know the mechanics of prompt engineering,
        what text you type in the box, yes.\nBut you also need to know how much you
        trust the tool, and whether you can rely on its results \u2013 if you don\u2019t,
        the output is useless.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-a-lovely-sense-of-gender\">What
        a lovely sense of ~gender~</h2>\n\n<p>There are some personal reasons why
        Monki\_Gras feels a bit special.</p>\n\n<p>I went to the last Monki\_Gras
        in 2019.\nIt was cancelled in 2020 thanks to COVID, and this is the first
        year it\u2019s been back \u2013 five years later!\nA lot of stuff has changed
        in that time.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, I was starting to explore what being genderfluid
        might mean for me, how that might affect my professional career, and I had
        several meaningful conversations with now-friends at Monki\_Gras.\nIn 2024,
        I have a better understanding of what my gender looks like, I\u2019m much
        happier, and I\u2019m more comfortable presenting as my full self.</p>\n\n<p>At
        both events, my gender and my appearance have been a complete non-issue.\nPeople
        accept that I am who I say I am; there were no awkward stares or questions;
        I was never misgendered.\nI got to relax, and focus on the event rather than
        worrying if somebody was about to be weird.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s nice.</p>\n\n<p>This
        should be the norm at professional events, but it isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s
        a bit sad that I can\u2019t take it for granted.\nBut it\u2019s nice when
        it happens.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"linksrecommended-reading\">Links/recommended reading</h2>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>There are lots of books about the history of swing dancing
        and jazz music.\nI read <a href=\"https://www.swingpatrol.co.uk/swing-dance-book-scott-cupit/\"><em>Swing
        Dance</em> by Scott Cupit</a> as I was writing the talk because it\u2019s
        what I had to hand, but there are plenty of others.\nIt\u2019s a fun subject!</p>\n\n
        \   <p>If you\u2019re getting started, I\u2019d particularly recommend looking
        for information about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Manning\">Frankie
        Manning</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Miller\">Norma
        Miller</a>, two of the early pioneers of this style of dancing.</p>\n  </li>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>Most of the photos in the talk come from <a href=\"https://commons.flickr.org/\">the
        Flickr Commons</a>, a collection of historical photographs from over 100 international
        cultural heritage organisations.</p>\n\n    <p>You can learn more about the
        Commons, browse the photos, and see who\u2019s involved using the Commons
        Explorer <a href=\"https://commons.flickr.org/\">https://commons.flickr.org/</a>.\n(Which

        particular style of dancing they were doing was called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)\">swing
        dancing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Swing dancing is an umbrella term for a wide variety
        of energetic and rhythmic dance styles, usually danced to jazz music.\nProbably
        the most well-known is lindy hop, but it also includes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)\">balboa</a>,

        dance came out of the African American jazz scene in the early 20th century,
        and a lot of the moves practiced today have their roots in traditional African
        folk dances.</p>\n\n<p>Swing dancing is very popular today, and there\u2019s
        a thriving swing dance scene in London, so I was able to find a beginner class
        just five minutes from where I was working at the time.\nIt was closer than

        was a proper beginner class, no experience needed \u2013 which was good, because
        I didn\u2019t have any!\nYou could walk in having never danced before and
        they\u2019d teach you from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>This is great for students,
        but it poses a tricky challenge for the teachers.\nMany people are quite nervous
        in a dance class, unsure if they can do it, especially if it\u2019s their
        first time.\nThe teachers have to get you on board quickly, and I noticed
        a pattern \u2013 after a gentle warmup, they\u2019d always start with a really
        simple step.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I demonstrated with a simple step on
        stage.\nI don\u2019t have any video of this, so you\u2019ll have to make do
        with crude MS\_Paint drawings.</p>\n\n<p>This is a kick, kick, step.</p>\n\n\n\n<div

        and there\u2019s something satisfying about a whole room of people stepping
        in unison.</p>\n\n<p>From there, the class would gradually build to more complicated
        things \u2013 moves, turns, routines.\nBut we\u2019d always build something
        new in small steps, not doing too much at once.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/40556490133/\"><picture>

        \ </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Starting small is a great way to learn a
        new skill, and this approach can apply in a lot of areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re
        trying to learn a skill or embed a new habit, make the bar for success extremely
        low.\nThis is a one-two punch:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>You\u2019ll get that sense
        of achievement, the dopamine hit of reaching your goal.</li>\n  <li>You avoid
        the negative emotion of setting the bar too high and falling short.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The
        latter is a common mistake when we learn new skills as adults.\nWe\u2019re
        used to being good at things; we have high standards for ourselves.\nThen
        we try to learn something new, and we set our goal far too high, then we fall
        short, we bounce off.</p>\n\n<p>How many people have done this?\nPicked up
        a new skill, done it once, you weren\u2019t instantly good at it, so you never
        did it again.\n<em>[A lot of guilty faces in the audience for this one.]</em></p>\n\n<p>We
        don\u2019t like to be bad at things \u2013 but we can only learn if we push
        through the period of not being very good.\nWhen we\u2019re a beginner and
        we don\u2019t know very much, we need to set small goals and step forward
        gradually.</p>\n\n<p>This is where we come back to AI, to prompt engineering
        \u2013 which have been new skills for many of us in the last year or two.</p>\n\n<figure>\n

        I first tried these new generative AI tools, I was lured in by the big and
        flashy stuff.\nThat\u2019s what grabbed headlines; that\u2019s what grabbed
        my attention.\nI was reading Twitter, I thought <em>\u201Cthat looks fun,
        I want do to that\u201D</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I set a very high bar for what I wanted
        to achieve, and I wanted to replicate those cool results \u2013 but I didn\u2019t
        know what I was doing, so I couldn\u2019t do any of that cool stuff.\nSo I
        bounced off for months.\nI ignored these tools, because of the bitter taste
        of those initial failures.</p>\n\n<p>I only started doing useful stuff with
        these tools when I lowered my expectations.\nI wanted a small first step.\nWhat\u2019s
        a small step for AI?\nIt\u2019s a simple prompt; a single question; a single
        sentence.</p>\n\n<p>I went back and found the first ChatGPT sessions where
        I got something useful out of it.\nI was building a URL checker, I have a
        bunch of websites, I want to check they\u2019re up.\nI wanted to write a script
        to help me.\nSo I asked ChatGPT <em>\u201Chow do I fetch a single URL\u201D</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This
        is a simple task, something I could easily Google, and many of you probably
        already know how to do this.\nBut that\u2019s not the point \u2013 the point
        is that it gave me that initial feeling of success.\nIt was the first time
        I had that sense of <em>\u201Cooh, this could be useful\u201D</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I
        was able to build on that, and by asking more small questions I eventually
        got a non-trivial URL checker.\nA more experienced AI user could probably
        have written the entire program in a single prompt, and I couldn\u2019t, but
        that\u2019s okay \u2013 I still got something useful by asking a series of
        small, simple questions.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/40556490133/\"><picture>

        what happens when you want to move past the basics?</p>\n\n<p>In dancing,
        the next step is finding a partner.\nA lot of swing dances are partnered dances,
        there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_and_follow\">leader
        and a follower</a>.\nThe leader initiates the moves, the follower follows,
        together they make awesome dance magic.</p>\n\n<p>If you go back to the same
        classes and events, you dance with the same people.\nYou get to know them,
        what they can do, what they like and what they don\u2019t.\nYou develop a
        sense of rapport, and this is so important when dancing.\n<em>You have to
        find the right level of trust, what you both feel comfortable doing.</em>\nMaybe
        you\u2019re happy to dance a move with one person, but not with another.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s
        look at a few examples.</p>\n\n<p>In the photo above, the couple are dancing
        some sort of hand-to-hand jitterbug routine.\nThis is the sort of thing that
        you can teach a beginner in a couple of hours; nothing weird is going on here;
        it\u2019s the sort of move most dancers would happily dance with a complete
        stranger.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/quinet/43506977094/in/photolist-29hyCwJ\"><picture>

        do we learn to trust AI?\nI think this will be a key question as we use more
        and more of these tools.\nHow do we build mental models of what we can trust?\nHow
        do we help everyone find the right level of trust for them?\nHow do we work
        out when we do and don\u2019t trust them?\nThe same techniques we\u2019ve

        move in your repetoire \u2013 you start with simpler moves, and you get a
        sense of each other\u2019s comfort.\nAre you both dancing energetically? Confidentally?
        Does it feel safe to do something more complicated?\nOr is your partner nervous?
        Wary? Perhaps at the edge of their comfort zone?</p>\n\n<p>We can do something
        similar with AI.\nOne thing I\u2019ve found useful when testing new tools
        is to ask it something simple, something I already know how to do.\nIf I see

        want to give you a few practical examples.</p>\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s important
        to work in areas where you already have a decent understanding.\nWe know these
        tools can hallucinate.\nWe know they can make stuff up.\nWe know they can
        go off the rails.</p>\n\n<p>The safeguard is us, the human, and we need to
        be able to spot when they\u2019ve gone off the rails and need guiding back
        to the straight and narrow.</p>\n\n<p>We all have different areas of competence
        and expertise \u2013 the areas where we trust AI are going to be different
        for each us.\nSo I might trust an AI to tell me about digital preservation
        or dance styles, but I wouldn\u2019t ask it questions about farming or firefighting

        tool.\nI give it a discussion topic, and rather than asking it for answers,
        I ask it to tell me what sort of things I should be considering.</p>\n\n<p>I
        used ChatGPT to help me write this talk.\nI described the broad premise of
        the talk, and I asked it to tell me what aspects I should consider.\nWhat
        should I discuss?\nWhat could I say?\nWhat might my audience want to hear?\nI
        didn\u2019t use any of its output directly, but it gave me some stuff to think
        about.\nSome of it was bad, some of it I already had, some of its suggestions
        were useful additions to the talk.</p>\n\n<p>This is an inversion of the prompter/promptee
        relationship: I\u2019m not giving the computer a topic to think about it;
        it\u2019s giving me topics to think about.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3925727501/\"><picture>

        if I want more than ideas, what if I want some facts?</p>\n\n<p>AI tools are
        unreliable sources of facts, and you always have to be careful.\nThey can
        make up nonsense, and repeat them as if they\u2019re facts with complete confidence
        and authority.\nIt\u2019s mansplaining as a service.</p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s
        not like they don\u2019t know any facts, and sometimes they do get them right.\nThe
        right level of trust isn\u2019t absolute faith or complete scepticism, it\u2019s
        somewhere in between.\nHow do we know when to trust them?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve
        settled on the idea that AI is like a friend who\u2019s read a Wikipedia article
        \u2013 maybe after having a few beers.\nThere\u2019s definitely something
        behind what they\u2019re remembering, but it may not always be right.\nI wouldn\u2019t
        rely on it for anything important, but if often contains a clue to something
        which is true \u2013 a name, an idea, some terminology that leads me towards
        more trustworthy reference material.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3925727501/\"><picture>

        finally, I use AI for writing code.</p>\n\n<p>But again, I stick to areas
        where I already have some expertise.\nI use these tools to write code in languages
        I use, frameworks I\u2019m familiar with, problems that I can understand.</p>\n\n<p>When
        I\u2019m working with a team of human developers, I sometimes have to pass
        on doing a code review because I don\u2019t know enough to do a proper review.\nThat\u2019s
        my threshold for using AI tools \u2013 if I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable reviewing
        the code, I don\u2019t trust the two of us to write it together.\nThere\u2019s
        too much of a risk that I\u2019ll miss a subtle mistake or major bug.</p>\n\n<p>But
        that still leaves a lot of use cases!</p>\n\n<p>I use it for a lot of boilerplate
        code.\nIt\u2019s a good way to get certain repetitive utility functions.\nAnd
        it\u2019s particularly useful when there are tools that have a complicated
        interface, and I have to get the list of fiddly options correct (ffmpeg springs
        to mind).\nIt\u2019s quite tricky to get the right set of incantations, but
        once I\u2019ve got them it\u2019s easy to see if they\u2019re behaving correctly.</p>\n\n<figure>\n

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2024/moving-youtube-likes/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>I
        used to have two YouTube accounts, and I wanted to consolidate them into one.</p>\n\n<p>I
        had two accounts as a way to keep two separate watch histories.\nI was watching
        videos about gender and trans stuff before I came out, and I didn\u2019t want
        them appearing in my main account \u2013 say, when I was listening to music
        at work.\nThat\u2019s less of a concern now than it was five or six years
        ago, and the lines between them have become blurry.\nI don\u2019t need two
        accounts any more.</p>\n\n<p>Because I only use YouTube for watching videos,
        and not posting, there were only three lists I really wanted to keep: my subscriptions,
        my Watch Later queue, and my Likes.\nMy subs and watch later were both small
        enough to copy by hand; the likes were the hard bit \u2013 I had about 1500
        or so.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no built-in way to move Likes between YouTube
        accounts, so it was time to break out the YouTube API.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-authentication-working\">Getting
        authentication working</h2>\n\n<p>The first step was getting some API credentials.\nThis
        uses the Google Cloud console, which I\u2019m not super familiar with, but
        YouTube has a lot of quickstart guides and code samples which made the process
        much easier.</p>\n\n<p>I used the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python\">Python
        quickstart guide</a>, and went through the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n
        \ <li>Create a project in the Google Cloud console</li>\n  <li>Enable the
        YouTube Data API for that project</li>\n  <li>Create some OAuth credentials,
        which came in a JSON file I had to download</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At some point
        during this process, I had to create an OAuth consent screen.\nIf I was publishing
        this app for the world to use, you\u2019d see this as signing into the app,
        and it would have to be reviewed by Google.\nBecause I was only writing scripts
        for me, I was able to mostly skip this step \u2013 I left the app with a \u201Ctesting\u201D
        status, and just listed my two YouTube accounts as \u201Ctest users\u201D:</p>\n\n<picture>\n

        I run this, the script kicks me out into a web browser, where I have to go
        through the usual Google login screen, and confirm I want to use this app.\nAfter
        I clicked through a few confirmation screens, my browser eventually got to
        a page that said:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>The authentication flow
        has completed. You may close this window.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>and
        back in my terminal window, the script was running and printing a list of
        my playlists.</p>\n\n<p>Already this was further than I\u2019d got in the
        past \u2013 I had an authenticated API client, and it was retrieving real
        data from my YouTube account.\nGood progress!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-the-authentication-better\">Making
        the authentication better</h2>\n\n<p>The authentication code above works,
        but it has two major issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>It\u2019s reading
        my OAuth client config from a JSON file on disk.\nCredentials should never
        be stored in plain text, so I want to put that somewhere more secure.</p>\n
        \ </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>It doesn\u2019t remember the credentials from <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flow.run_local_server()</code>
        \u2013 every time I run the script, I have to go through the in-browser authentication
        flow.\nI was running the script many times as I gradually built up the code,
        and this quickly got annoying.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of these issues
        can be solved using the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/keyring/\">keyring
        module</a>, which provides a platform-agnostic interface to the system password
        store (in my case, the login keychain on macOS).</p>\n\n<p>I changed the function
        to fetch the OAuth client config from the keychain, and to store retrieved
        credentials in the keychain.\nWhen I run it repeatedly, it retrieves the stored
        credentials rather than sending me back through the in-browser flow.</p>\n\n<p>After
        running these scripts for a while, I discovered that Google\u2019s OAuth credentials
        expire after about a week.\nI wrote some rudimentary code to handle credential
        expiry \u2013 it deletes the stored credentials, and sends me back through
        the in-browser flow.\nThere are almost certainly better ways to do this, but
        my simplistic approach worked well enough for my one-off script.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s
        my updated function:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div

        15 February 2024:</strong> the original version of this code called the <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">videos()</code> endpoint and
        filtered for my likes, but that was only able to see the first 1000 likes.
        That was fine for this project, where I was gradually deleting the list, but
        not in general. I\u2019ve changed it to use the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">playlistItems()</code> API, which seems to return the
        full set.]</p>\n\n<p>This generates videos in reverse order of liking them
        \u2013 the most recently liked video comes first.\nThe items are large dicts
        which include various metadata fields about each video, of which the most
        interesting one to me is the ID:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-`python\">{'id':
        'J-u2aW7T2bw', \u2026}\n{'id': 'XPaKAh2zxgk', \u2026}\n{'id': '-q7ZVXOU3kM',
        \u2026}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I wrote a couple of methods which like/unlike
        a video.\nBecause these are modifying data in YouTube, I had to change the
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scopes</code> to <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube</code>,
        replacing the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">youtube.readonly</code>
        scope I\u2019d been using previously.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python

        the likes from the old account wasn\u2019t strictly necessary \u2013 I was
        planning to close the account when I was done \u2013 but it was an easy way
        to track the progress, and turned out to be helpful towards the end of the
        process (more on that below).</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, around the time I wrote
        this code, David published a post about <a href=\"https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-13-08:28.html\">writing
        good programming abstractions</a>, and I think this is a nice example of one.\nWrapping
        these API calls in a couple of named functions doesn\u2019t do anything to
        help de-duplication, but it does make the intent of the final script much
        clearer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"running-the-code-in-practice\">Running the code in
        practice</h2>\n\n<p>By and large this code worked extremely well.\nAlmost
        all of the videos moved across seamlessly, and I could watch it in two side-by-side
        browser windows \u2013 likes appeared in one account as they disappeared from
        the other.\nIt was substantially quicker and easier than if I\u2019d tried
        to do it by hand.</p>\n\n<p>I did run into a couple of non-obvious issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>The YouTube API has a quota, and I burnt through it pretty
        quickly.\nYou get 10,000\_units per day, and rating a video (aka like/unlike)
        <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost\">costs
        50\_units</a>.\nI had to make two calls to move each video (one like, one
        unlike), so I could only move about 100 videos a day.</p>\n\n    <p>The quota
        resets at midnight Pacific Time, or about 8am in London.\nI got into the habit
        of running the script once a day, every day, until I\u2019d moved my entire
        list of Liked videos.\nIt took a while, but still less than doing it by hand!</p>\n\n
        \   <p>You can apply for a quota increase, but I didn\u2019t bother \u2013
        I knew I\u2019d only run into the quota a handful of times, and it was easier
        to spread my runs over multiple days than fill in an application for more
        quota.\nThe docs say it can take a week or so to approve quota increases,
        by which I\u2019d probably be done.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sometimes
        I\u2019d get a 403 error with the message <em>\u201CThe owner of the video
        that you are trying to rate has disabled ratings for that video\u201D</em>.</p>\n\n
        \   <p>I\u2019m not sure what this means \u2013 if I opened the video in my
        web browser, I could still use the like/unlike buttons.\nThis only affected
        a handful of videos in my entire list, so I just used my web browser to move
        them across.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The API couldn\u2019t see the last
        dozen or so videos.\nOn the last day of running the script, the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">get_liked_videos()</code> function returned an empty list,
        but I could still see some liked videos in the old account in my web browser.\nI\u2019m
        not sure why they were invisible to the API.</p>\n\n    <p>Again, because
        it was only a handful of videos, I moved them across by hand.</p>\n\n    <p>[<strong>Edit,
        15 February 2024:</strong> I think this was caused by my use of the <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">videos()</code> API instead
        of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">playlistItems()</code>;
        see above.]</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These were relatively minor issues,
        and easy to work around.\nAnd once I\u2019d finished running this script,
        I was able to close the old account and throw away this code \u2013 but maybe
        I\u2019ll come back to these notes if I have another interesting idea for
        using the YouTube API.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks

        version of this has been floating around the Internet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hassmanm/status/303086542\">since
        2007</a>, probably earlier.\nThis tweet is pretty emblematic of posts about
        this claim: it\u2019s stated as pure fact, with no supporting evidence or
        explanation.\nWe\u2019re meant to just accept that a single PDF can only cover
        about half the area of Germany, and we\u2019re not given any reason why 381\_kilometres
        is the magic limit.</p>\n\n<p>I started wondering: has anybody made a PDF
        this big?\nHow hard would it be?\nCan you make a PDF that\u2019s even bigger?</p>\n\n<p>A
        few years ago I did some <a href=\"https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/48938/13285\">silly
        noodling into PostScript</a>, the precursor to PDF, and it was a lot of fun.\nI\u2019ve
        never actually dived into the internals of PDF, and this seems like a good
        opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dig in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-does-the-claim-come-from\">Where
        does the claim come from?</h2>\n\n<p>These posts are often accompanied by
        a \u201Cwell, actually\u201D where people in the replies explain this is a
        limitation of a particular PDF reader app, not a limitation of PDF itself.\nThey
        usually link to something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#:~:text=Page%20dimensions%20are%20not%20limited%20by%20the%20format%20itself\">the
        Wikipedia article for PDF</a>, which explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Page
        dimensions are not limited by the format itself. However, Adobe Acrobat imposes
        a limit of 15\_million by 15\_million inches, or 225 trillion in<sup>2</sup>
        (145,161 km<sup>2</sup>).<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#cite_note-pdf-ref-1.7-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If
        you follow the reference link, you find the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081001170454/https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf\">specification
        for PDF\_1.7</a>, where an appendix item explains in more detail (emphasis
        mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In PDF versions earlier than PDF\_1.6, the
        size of the default user space unit is fixed at 1/72\_inch. In Acrobat viewers
        earlier than version 4.0, the minimum allowed page size is 72 by 72\_units
        in default user space (1 by 1\_inch); the maximum is 3240 by 3240\_units (45
        by 45\_inches). In Acrobat versions 5.0 and later, the minimum allowed page
        size is 3 by 3\_units (approximately 0.04 by 0.04\_inch); the maximum is 14,400
        by 14,400\_units (200 by 200\_inches).</p>\n\n  <p>Beginning with PDF\_1.6,
        the size of the default user space unit may be set with the UserUnit entry
        of the page dictionary. <strong>Acrobat 7.0 supports a maximum UserUnit value
        of 75,000, which gives a maximum page dimension of 15,000,000\_inches (14,400
        * 75,000 * 1 \u2044 72).</strong> The minimum UserUnit value is 1.0 (the default).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>15\_million
        inches is exactly 381\_kilometres, matching the number in the original tweet.\nAnd
        although this limit first appeared in PDF\_1.6, it\u2019s \u201Cversion 7\u201D
        of Adobe Acrobat.\nThis is probably where the original claim comes from.</p>\n\n<p>What
        if we make a PDF that exceeds these \u201Cmaximum\u201D values?</p>\n\n<h2

        never dived into the internals of a PDF document \u2013 I\u2019ve occasionally
        glimpsed some bits in a hex editor, but I\u2019ve never really understood
        how they work.\nIf I\u2019m going to be futzing around for fun, this is a
        good opportunity to learn how to edit the PDF directly, rather than going
        through a library.</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://help.callassoftware.com/a/798383-how-to-create-a-simple-pdf-file\">a
        good article</a> which explains the internal structure of a PDF, and combined
        with asking ChatGPT a few questions, I was able to get enough to write some
        simple files by hand.</p>\n\n<p>I know that PDFs support a huge number of
        features, so this is probably a gross oversimplification, but this is the
        mental picture I created:</p>\n\n\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"

        start and end of a PDF file are always the same: a version number (<code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">%PDF-1.6</code>) and an end-of-file marker (<code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">%%EOF</code>).</p>\n\n<p>After the version number comes
        a long list of objects.\nThere are lots of types of objects, for all the various
        things you can find in a PDF, including the pages, the text, and the graphics.</p>\n\n<p>After
        that list comes the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">xref</code>
        or cross-reference table, which is a lookup table for the objects.\nIt points
        to all the objects in the file: it tells you that object 1 is 10\_bytes after
        the start, object 2 is after 20\_bytes, object 3 is after 30\_bytes, and so
        on.\nBy looking at this table, a PDF reading app knows how many objects there
        are in the file, and where to find them.</p>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">trailer</code> contains some metadata about the overall
        document, like the number of pages and whether it\u2019s encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>Finally,
        the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">startxref</code>
        value is a pointer to the start of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">xref</code>
        table.\nThis is where a PDF reading app starts: it works from the end of the
        file until it finds the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">startxref</code>
        value, then it can go and read the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">xref</code>
        table and learn about all the objects.</p>\n\n<p>With this knowledge, I was
        able to write my first PDF by hand.\nIf you save this code into a file named

        with this file for a while, just doing simple things like adding extra shapes,
        changing how the shapes appeared, and putting different shapes on different
        pages.\nI tried for a while to get text working, but that was a bit beyond
        me.</p>\n\n<p>It quickly became apparent why nobody writes PDFs by hand \u2013
        it got very fiddly to redo all the lookup tables!\nBut I\u2019m glad I did
        it; manipulating all the PDF objects and their references really helped me
        feel like I understand the basic model of PDFs.\nI opened some \u201Creal\u201D
        PDFs created by other apps, and they have many more objects and types of object
        \u2013 but now I could at least follow some of what\u2019s going on.</p>\n\n<p>With
        this newfound ability to edit PDFs by hand, how can I create monstrously big
        ones?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changing-the-page-size-mediabox-and-userunit\">Changing
        the page size: /MediaBox and /UserUnit</h2>\n\n<p>Within a PDF, the size of

        different pages to be different sizes.\nWe\u2019ve already seen this once:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>&lt;&lt;\n\t/Type

        page \u2013 in this case, a square of 300 \xD7 300\_units.\nThe default unit
        size is 1/72\_inch, so the page is 300 \xD7 72 = 4.17\_inches.\nAnd indeed,

        example, if we change the value to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">600
        600</code>, Acrobat says it\u2019s now <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">8.33
        x 8.33 in</code>.\nNice!</p>\n\n<p>We can increase it all the way to <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">14400 14400</code>, the max
        allowed by Acrobat, and then it says the page is now <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">200.00 x 200.00in</code>.\n(You <a href=\"/images/2024/acrobat-error.png\">get
        a warning</a> if you try to push past that limit.)</p>\n\n<p>But 200\_inches
        is far short of 381\_kilometres \u2013 and that\u2019s because we\u2019re
        using the default unit of 1/72\_inch.\nWe can increase the unit size by adding
        a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/UserUnit</code> value.\nFor
        exaple, setting the value to 2 will double the page in both dimensions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;&lt;\n\t/Type
        /Page\n\t/Parent 3 0 R\n\t<span class=\"mediaBox\">/MediaBox [0 0 14400 14400]</span>\n\t<span
        class=\"mediaBox\">/UserUnit 2</span>\n\t/Contents 1 0 R\n&gt;&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>And
        now Acrobat reports the size of the page as <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">400.00 x 400.00 in</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If we crank it all
        the way up to the maximum of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">UserUnit
        75000</code>, Acrobat now reports the size of our page as <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">15,000,000.00 x 15,000,000.00 in</code> \u2013 381 km
        along both sides, matching the original claim.\nIf you\u2019re curious, you
        can <a href=\"/files/2024/biggest.pdf\">download the PDF</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If
        you try to create a page with a larger size, either by increasing the <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">MediaBox</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">UserUnit</code> values, Acrobat just ignores it.\nIt keeps
        saying that the size of a page is 15\_million inches, even if the page metadata
        says it\u2019s higher.\n(And if you increase the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">UserUnit</code> past <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">75000</code>, this happens silently \u2013 there\u2019s
        no warning or error to suggest the size of the page is being capped.)</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Edit,
        1 February 2024:</strong> some extra zeroes slipped into the original version
        of this post \u2013 it\u2019s a million inches, not a billion. Thanks to <a
        href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39211537\">mrb on Hacker News</a>
        for spotting the mistake!]</p>\n\n<p>This probably isn\u2019t an issue \u2013
        I don\u2019t think the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">UserUnit</code>
        value is widely used in practice.\nI found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/59927201/1558022\">one
        Stack Overflow answer</a> saying as such, and I couldn\u2019t find any examples
        of it online.\nThe builtin macOS Preview.app doesn\u2019t even support it
        \u2013 it completely ignores the value, and treats all PDFs as if the unit
        size is 1/72\_inch.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike Acrobat, the Preview app doesn\u2019t
        have an upper limit on what we can put in <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">MediaBox</code>.\nIt\u2019s perfectly happy for me to
        write a width which is a 1 followed by twelve 0s:</p>\n\n<picture>\n  <source

        flamingo who\u2019s become a constant companion when I go to the show.\n(Why
        a flamingo?\nBecause of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Q5ljDokFA&amp;t=134s\">one
        verse in a single song</a> that has turned the humble flamingo into an icon
        in the fandom.)</p>\n\n<p>Both of us were wearing bow ties to cosplay as Ian
        Fleming, who\u2019s both a character in the musical and the co-author of a
        memo that laid the seeds for the real-life operation.\nAnd Ian Fleming was
        a part-time novelist, part-time spy, so it made sense for us to be carrying
        a stack of his books.</p>\n\n<p>I did look in a couple of charity shops for
        old Ian Fleming novels, but I couldn\u2019t find any.\nLacking real books,
        I decided that the only alternative was to make my own.</p>\n\n<p>This led
        to a series of props that are, if anything, over-arsed: the Collected Works
        of Ian Flemingo.\nThese are a collection of postcards with covers based on
        the real James Bond books\u2026 sort of:</p>\n\n<picture>\n  \n  <source srcset=\"/images/2024/ian-flemingo-fronts2_1x.avif

        width=\"750\">\n</picture>\n\n<p>On the other side of the cards, I wrote pun-filled
        blurbs that are based loosely on the original books.\nI got the original blurbs
        from Amazon listings, then stuffed them with puns and references to the show.\nAt
        one point I did consider including testimonials from characters, but I didn\u2019t
        have space.</p>\n\n<p>The books are published by \u201CEl Otro Editora\u201D,
        a reference to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spitlip/status/1747330685986066878\">\u201CEl
        Otro Periodico\u201D</a>, a fan-produced newspaper, which is in turn named
        after the line \u201Cel otro telefono\u201D.\nThe price is \u201C6d\u201D,
        which is the one mistake that really irks me \u2013 I meant the cost to be
        a ha\u2019penny, but instead it\u2019s half a shilling.\nOops.\n(Why a ha\u2019penny?\nBecause
        of a line in the show.)</p>\n\n<p>My favourite touch is the barcodes in the
        corner.\nThis is what makes it feel like a \u201Creal\u201D book to me \u2013
        and every book has a unique barcode, and they can be scanned!</p>\n\n<p>Initially
        I picked random numbers as the ISBNs, but I got worried about where they might
        be pointing \u2013 maybe I\u2019d accidentally pick a real ISBN that pointed
        at an offensive book?</p>\n\n<p>Then I looked for ISBNs that could be used
        safely.\nFor example, I know there are <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for-industry/numbering/numbers-for-drama\">telephone
        numbers</a> that are reserved for fictional purposes, so a phone number that
        appears in a TV show won\u2019t accidentally lead to a deluge of calls for
        the person on the other end.\nBut although lots of ISBNs are used for fiction
        books, there aren\u2019t any ranges reserved for fiction<em>al</em> books.\n(And
        yes, I did look up the <a href=\"https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation\">ISBN
        specifications</a> to see if there were any ranges reserved for this purpose.\nThis
        project is nothing if not ridiculous.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I did the obvious
        thing \u2013 I just dropped in the ISBNs for the original Ian Fleming books.\nSo
        if you scan the barcodes, you\u2019ll find a James Bond book.</p>\n\n<p>I
        printed the cards themselves using <a href=\"https://www.instantprint.co.uk/\">InstantPrint</a>,
        who did a great job \u2013 the cards feel nice in the hand, and they were
        delivered quickly on a tight deadline.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <picture>\n  \n

        taking them out of my bag and just turning them over in my hands as I admired
        the shiny, shiny thing.\nI don\u2019t expect to print more of these particular
        books, but I can see myself doing more custom postcards in future \u2013 it\u2019s
        nice to have physical souvenirs in an increasingly online world.</p>\n\n<p>I
        gave out a bunch of the postcards as OHT souvenirs on Monday, and people liked

        me answer some FAQs, and then I\u2019ll explain how it works:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why
        can\u2019t we just use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;input
        type=\"number\"&gt;</code>?</strong>\nAs many people are fond of saying, age
        is a state of mind, not a number.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will this input UI work
        on all devices?</strong>\nThis is definitely on the wide side, but I tried
        it on the 52\u2032 DiamondVision Ultra Mega Display where I do all my web
        development, and it fits just fine on there.\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s all
        the testing we need, and nobody would ever have a smaller display where this
        design doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I license this UI to use in
        my apps?</strong>\nYou certainly can!\nJust send your mail-order form to me
        at the Institute of Good Ideas, Potassium Plaza, Rainy England.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s
        on your roadmap for V2?</strong>\nAdding a tinny MP3 of \u201CHappy birthday\u201D
        that autoplays at maximum volume whenever this UI is on screen.</p>\n\n<p>I
        think we can all agree that this is a brilliant idea, and I\u2019m sure all
        the major browsers will implement it within weeks.\nI look forward to getting
        my cheques in the post.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n\n<p>The
        cake is drawn entirely using SVG animations, which I haven\u2019t used before.\nI\u2019m
        quite pleased with how well it works, and how close I was able to get to my
        original idea.\nI know there are quite a few ways to do animation on the web;
        I wanted to experiment with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate\">SVG
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;animate&gt;</code>
        tag</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea of the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">&lt;animate&gt;</code> tag is that you can tell it different
        values that an attribute of an element can take over time.\nFor example, here
        I\u2019m animating a rectangle by increasing the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">width</code> it from 0 to 100, and then decreasing it
        back to 0 again:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-xml highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;rect</span>
        <span class=\"na\">width=</span><span class=\"s\">\"10\"</span> <span class=\"na\">height=</span><span
        class=\"s\">\"10\"</span> <span class=\"na\">fill=</span><span class=\"s\">\"black\"</span><span
        class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;animate</span>\n    <span
        class=\"na\">attributeName=</span><span class=\"s\">\"width\"</span>\n    <span
        class=\"na\">values=</span><span class=\"s\">\"0;100;0\"</span>\n    <span
        class=\"na\">dur=</span><span class=\"s\">\"20s\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">repeatCount=</span><span
        class=\"s\">\"5\"</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/rect&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>which
        looks like:</p>\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0
        100 10\" width=\"100%\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n  <rect
        width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"black\">\n    <animate attributename=\"width\"
        values=\"0;100;0\" dur=\"20s\" repeatcount=\"indefinite\"></animate>\n  </rect>\n</svg>\n\n<p>It\u2019s
        pretty flexible \u2013 you can animate multiple properties on the same element;
        you can change non-numeric attributes like <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">fill</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">stroke</code>;
        you have a lot of control over how the animation behaves.\nI did some brief
        experiments with simple shapes, enough to get a sense of how I could use it.</p>\n\n<p>Now
        I knew how to animate attributes on SVG, I made a small icon of a static birthday
        cake.\nThere are plenty of existing icons like this on the web, but I made
        my own so I could keep the shapes simple \u2013 most icon sets are just a
        giant <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;path&gt;</code>
        exported from a drawing app, which I\u2019d have to unpick.\nAnimating that
        would be harder than just creating my own icon.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a
        little pencil-drawn sketch to work out the rough geometry, then I wrote the
        SVG by hand.\nI still find it vaguely relaxing to create pictures from code.\nThis
        is what I came up with:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"two_columns\">\n  <picture>\n

        black-and-white icon of a birthday cake. The cake has two layers and five
        candles on top.</title></svg>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Most of this is fairly vanilla
        SVG, using stuff I\u2019ve written about before.\nThe candle flames and the
        curving line are both using <a href=\"/2021/inner-outer-strokes-svg/\">SVG
        masks</a>, and the curves are drawn as a collection of <a href=\"/2022/circle-party/\">circular
        arcs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The one interesting bit is the rounded corners on the
        two layers of cake, where only the top two corners are rounded.\nYou can set
        the corner radius of an SVG <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;rect&gt;</code>
        with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/rx\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rx</code> attribute</a>, and
        you get the same curve on all four corners \u2013 unlike the CSS <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">border-radius</code> property</a>,
        which allows you to pick different radii for each corner.</p>\n\n<p>To get
        curves on just two corners, I overlapped two rectangles \u2013 one with and
        without rounded corners.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  \n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"

        id=\"svg_round-rect\">You can combine a rectangle with square corners and
        a pill shape to get a rectangle with two rounded corners on top.</title></svg>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Because
        I\u2019m only doing a solid fill, I\u2019m rendering the two rectangles directly
        in the image \u2013 but if I wanted a more complex fill, I could use this
        to create as a mask that I applied to another shape.</p>\n\n<p>Once I had
        my basic icon, I created an extended version that has several hundred candles
        on it.\nThis is what the cake looks like when it\u2019s fully complete:</p>\n\n<figure

        \ </svg>\n<title id=\"svg_big-birthday-cake\">A black-and-white illustration
        of an extremely wide birthday cake.</title></svg>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This
        has something like 200 candles on it; in hindsight I was way off my estimate
        of how old the oldest humans are.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldest_people\">oldest
        humans</a> are closer to 120 years old.</p>\n\n<p>I then sprinkled <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">&lt;animate&gt;</code> elements everywhere to make different
        parts of the cake appear at different times.\nFor the plate and the two cake
        layers, I\u2019m animating the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">width</code>
        attributes, so they gradually get bigger.</p>\n\n<p>For the candles, I\u2019m
        applying a mask which has an animated <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">width</code>
        attribute, so it gradually allows more and more of the candles to be seen.\nThat
        animation uses <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/calcMode\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">calcMode=\"discrete\"</code></a>,
        which causes it to do a distinct step at each tick, rather than a smooth animation
        between the two.\nThis means that you only ever see whole candles, rather
        than half-candles in the middle of the animation.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I added
        an animation to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">viewBox</code>
        attribute of the overall SVG \u2013 this means the width of the SVG increases
        as more candles become visible.\nThis allows me to get the current state of
        the animation in JavaScript:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nf\">getComputedStyle</span><span
        class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span
        class=\"nf\">querySelector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span
        class=\"s1\">svg</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">))[</span><span
        class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">width</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span
        class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 158px</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>I
        know how far apart the candles are spaced, so I can use this to work out how
        many are visible at any given time.\nThere are other ways to inspect the state
        of an in-progress SVG animation; tying it to the geometry was the easiest

        noise is how males attract females, and it\u2019s so important that their
        internal organs are actually shaped around their ability to honk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>The most noticeable anatomical features of the male involve sound production.
        The larynx is one-half the length of the vertebral column and fills most of
        the thoracic cavity, pushing the heart, lungs and alimentary canal backward
        and sideways.</p>\n\n  <p><cite>\u2014 <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mspecies/article/doi/10.2307/3504110/2600338\"><em>Hypsignathus

        paper</a> also features a delightful description of the male nose, which sounds
        like somebody getting revenge for the way male authors describe women in novels:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Males have a large, square, truncated head (Tate, 1942) with enormous
        pendulous lips, ruffles around a warty snout and a hairless, split chin (Lang
        and Chapin, 1917).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I find myself down this sort of
        rabbit hole surprisingly often, and I\u2019ve begun to think of it as \u201Cserendipitous
        search results\u201D.\nWhatever Ziva is, she\u2019s definitely not an African
        species of large bat, but it appeared in my search results anyway, and that
        was the start of some fun reading.\nAt other times, I\u2019ll look for a specific
        book at my local library, and they don\u2019t have it, but I\u2019ll end up
        reading half a dozen books with similar titles because that\u2019s what the
        search could find.</p>\n\n<p>If you want more pictures of cool bats, there
        are a bunch of them <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/144407784\">on

        read 75 books this year, which is slightly up on previous years (<a href=\"/2022/2022-in-reading/\">2022</a>,
        <a href=\"/2021/2021-in-reading/\">2021</a>).\nI\u2019m pleased with that
        number, although overall I found it a slightly disappointing year for reading.\nAlthough
        I read more books, there were less that I really loved \u2013 less of the
        sort of book that changes my view on the world, that I\u2019m still thinking
        about weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>I did return to a couple of favourite authors,
        who all released new books that I enjoyed \u2013 Alexandria Bellefleur, Toshikazu
        Kawaguchi, Maureen Johnson \u2013 but that was more familiar feelings than
        new.\nI got more of my novelty from theatre than books this year.</p>\n\n<p>About
        half of what I read came from my local library, including four of the books
        on the list below.\nThe library was particularly helpful for the \u201Cgood,
        but not great\u201D books that I know I won\u2019t read again.\nI was glad
        to return the books, and not have them taking up space in my house.\nI expect
        to continue leaning on my library next year.</p>\n\n<p>I continue to write
        short reviews of books I\u2019ve read at <a href=\"https://books.alexwlchan.net\">https://books.alexwlchan.net</a>,
        and keep notes in Obsidian.\nThe latter have been useful for jogging my memory,
        including as I write this post.</p>\n\n<p>Below are the best books I read
        in 2023, in the order I read them.\nNote that it\u2019s quite a heavy selection,
        several dealing with death and oppression and other unpleasant things.\nI
        do recommend them all, but you should have a cheery book to read afterwards.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<div

        on the \u201Cwhat if\u201D concept.</p>\n\n<p>Iris has run away to the forest
        to escape her abusive wife, and there she meets an alternate version of herself
        who made different choices \u2013 an Iris who married someone different, and
        now carries an unwanted pregnancy.\nThey both have regrets about how their
        life turned out, and envy some aspects of the other\u2019s life \u2013 but
        they also learn that the grass isn\u2019t always greener.</p>\n\n<p>The book
        switches back and forth between \u201CBefore\u201D (the events leading up
        to her running away) and \u201CAfter\u201D (what she does in the woods).\nYou
        know that something bad has happened to Iris, but you only find out the details
        slowly.\nI enjoy this sort of non-linear story.</p>\n\n<p>It gave me a lot
        of thoughts and feelings, and I felt sympathy for Iris.\nBoth Irises have
        flawed and imperfect lives, and there\u2019s no implication that one is obviously
        better or more correct.\nI haven\u2019t read it again, but I want to, because
        I suspect there\u2019s a lot I\u2019d pick up on a second time round.</p>\n\n<p>Content
        warnings for abuse, sexual assault, rape, and suicide.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, I technically
        read this in 2022, but it missed the cutoff for last year\u2019s post.)</p>\n\n<div

        March 2023</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is an account of abuse,
        neglect, and deaths of Indigenous students in Canada\u2019s school system.\nIt\u2019s
        not an easy book to read, but it\u2019s well-written and worth the time.</p>\n\n<p>It
        focuses on seven deaths in Thunder Bay, and includes the history of the residential
        schools which form the backdrop for those events.\nAs I don\u2019t know much
        about Canadian history or education, I found the context useful.</p>\n\n<p>The
        titular \u201CSeven Fallen Feathers\u201D are seven children who died in unexplained
        circumstances.\nThe book devotes a chapter to each of them, describing their
        history, the days leading up to their death, and the hole it left in the lives
        of their friends and family.\nIt\u2019s difficult to read but important, and
        the author has obviously done a lot of research and interviews.</p>\n\n<p>There
        are certain themes that keep coming up \u2013 racism towards Indigenous people,
        disinterest from the Thunder Bay police, the effect of moving kids to big
        cities \u2013 but the author is subtle about them.\nShe doesn\u2019t need
        to tell you what patterns you should be looking for, because it\u2019s so
        obvious from the stories.\nIt\u2019s the embodiment of \u201Cshow, don\u2019t
        tell\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>Content warnings for death, suicide, racism and colonialism.</p>\n\n<div

        fantasy and magic are real and commonplace, including vampires, ghosts, and
        evil scarecrows.</p>\n\n<p>Elatsoe (\u201CEllie\u201D) is a member of the
        Lipan Apache Tribe, and women in her family have the ability to speak to ghosts
        \u2013 usually animal ghosts, because human ghosts are more violent and angry.\nShe\u2019s
        investigating the death of her cousin Trevor, which she believes to be a murder.</p>\n\n<p>The
        plot is a little slow, but the worldbuilding is gorgeous \u2013 it feels rich
        and real, without being heavy-handed.\nWe get little glimpses of the magic,
        but it\u2019s never treated as spectacular or obsessed over.\nI didn\u2019t
        need to have every detail to enjoy it.\nI\u2019d happily read more stories
        in this setting, but it also works nicely as a standalone.</p>\n\n<p>This
        was Darcie Little Badger\u2019s debut novel, and I read her second novel,
        <em>A Snake Falls to Earth</em>, in August.\nIt was another good fantasy,
        and I\u2019ll definitely be reading more of her work in future.</p>\n\n<div

        about grief and heartbreak, and two people learning to find love again after
        great tragedy.</p>\n\n<p>The phone box itself is mundane, with no special
        magic or power.\nWhen I first saw the title, I wondered if this was a fantasy
        or sci-fi book \u2013 I was getting TARDIS vibes \u2013 but it\u2019s not,
        and that\u2019s a good thing.\nIt\u2019s just an ordinary phone box in a garden
        in Bell Gardia, a few hours from Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p>People go to the phone box
        to have conversations with their loved ones \u2013 often they\u2019re talking
        to people who have died, but not always.\nSome talk to estranged family, others
        talk to friends who are alive but mentally incapacitated or traumatised.\nThese
        conversations are largely private, and we don\u2019t get to hear many of them.</p>\n\n<p>Instead,
        the book focuses on a handful of characters \u2013 Sui, Takeshi, and Hana
        \u2013 and how they interact with the phone box, and its other visitors.\nThey\u2019ve
        all suffered losses, and their visits to the phone box are what help them
        to start reconnecting with people.</p>\n\n<p>It reminded me a lot of Toshikazu
        Kawaguchi\u2019s books, which I adore \u2013 grief and sadness but with an
        ultimately positive message.</p>\n\n<div class=\"book_review\" id=\"strong_female_character\">\n

        autism and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>I first saw Fern Brady when she appeared on
        <em>Taskmaster</em>, where she quickly became one of my favourite contestants.\nI
        loved how unapologetic she was about being herself, and how much fun she seemed
        to be having.\nWhen I learnt she was writing a memoir, I knew I had to read
        it.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the story of her growing up, being autistic, and the
        ways her behaviours have affected her life.\nThere\u2019s also a lot of discussion
        of how being a woman meant her autism was overlooked or ignored for a long
        time.\nIt felt genuine and raw, and it wasn\u2019t unrealistically hopeful
        or optimistic \u2013 it was a statement about what being an autistic woman
        is like.</p>\n\n<p>I definitely saw parallels with my own life, and it\u2019s
        given me plenty to think about.</p>\n\n<p>I was engrossed and read it in a
        single day; I was enjoying it so much I actually missed my train stop on the

        November 2023</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is a gripping and horrifying
        story of growing up in North Korea, then escaping as an adult.</p>\n\n<p>North
        Korea is a country I was only vaguely aware of, and most of my knowledge comes
        from pop culture stereotypes, so I learnt a lot from this book.\nIt\u2019s
        primarily a story about Jihyun\u2019s experience rather than North Korean
        politics, but even so it covers a lot of Korean history that was new to me.</p>\n\n<p>It
        starts when Jihyun was a child, in the early 1970s, and North Korea was less
        uncomfortable, if not exactly prosperous.\nShe grows up to be a school teacher
        as the economy declines, and then escapes through China when things get much
        worse \u2013 saving herself, but leaving her entire family behind.\nOne of
        the most moving chapters is a farewell letter to her father.</p>\n\n<p>The
        writing is clear and simple, with plenty of small details and individual stories.\nAs
        with <em>Seven Fallen Feathers</em>, this is a good example of \u201Cshow,
        don\u2019t tell\u201D.</p>\n\n<!-- The overall narrative is strong, but it's
        also full of small details and individual stories, which is the sort of thing

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2023/obsidian-open-note/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>I
        have a bunch of Python scripts I use to clean up text files, and I call them
        by passing the path to the text file as an argument, for example:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre
        class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>python
        clean_up_text.py /path/to/text/file.md\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This
        is mostly fine, but finding that path is a bit annoying when I want to run
        them on a note I have open in Obsidian.\nIt\u2019s not hard, it just takes
        a few steps \u2013 open the \u201CMore options\u201D menu, click \u201CReveal
        in Finder\u201D, drag the file from Finder into terminal.\nI wanted a way
        to make it a bit quicker.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve written a little script which
        gives me a path to the note I currently have open in Obsidian, so now I can
        run something more like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span>python clean_up_text.py <span class=\"si\">$(</span>path_to_frontmost_obsidian_note<span
        class=\"si\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve managed to
        do this with a bit of AppleScript and Python, even though Obsidian doesn\u2019t
        have any AppleScript support.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The inspiration for this script
        was another script I have for getting the frontmost URL from my web browser.\nThe
        crux of that script is a single line of AppleScript that controls Safari:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-applescript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre
        class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">tell</span><span class=\"w\">
        </span><span class=\"nb\">application</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span
        class=\"s2\">\"Safari\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">to</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">get</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span
        class=\"nv\">URL</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">of</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"na\">document</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span
        class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Unfortunately
        this isn\u2019t quite as simple in Obsidian \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have any
        AppleScript support, so you can\u2019t do anything with <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">tell application \"Obsidian\"</code>.</p>\n\n<p>(The lack
        of AppleScript is annoying, but understandable.\nIt\u2019s a niche technology
        on a marginal platform, and Apple seems to have completely forgotten it exists.\nMuch
        as I find AppleScript useful, it\u2019s hard to justify the time/effort to
        add support for it in a new app today.)</p>\n\n<p>But even if Obsidian doesn\u2019t
        have its own AppleScript dictionary, it is still visible from the AppleScript
        universe \u2013 as a process in System Events.\nWe can\u2019t see much, but
        we can see its windows, for example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-applescript
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"k\">tell</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">application</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"System Events\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n
        \   </span><span class=\"k\">tell</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">process</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"Obsidian\"</span><span class=\"w\">
        </span><span class=\"k\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">get</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"na\">title</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span
        class=\"k\">of</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">front</span><span
        class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"na\">window</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span
        class=\"k\">end</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">tell</span><span
        class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The window title has
        three parts, separated by hyphens: the name of the note, the name of the vault,
        and the Obsidian version:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Short story ideas - textfiles
        - Obsidian v1.4.16\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is the same title
        that shows up in the \u201CWindow\u201D menu \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of Obsidian
        poking into macOS where AppleScript can see it.\nBecause Obsidian always uses
        the title as the filename (e.g. this file is called <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">Short story ideas.md</code>), we can use this to find
        the path to the Markdown file.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To find the Markdown file,
        you match the vault name to a folder on disk, then you search for files that
        match the note title.\nThere are a bunch of ways you could do this; I picked
        Python because that\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with, but you could use
        another language just as easily.</p>\n\n<p>This is the script I wrote, which
        I named <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scripts/blob/main/macos/obnote\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">obnote</code></a>.\nHopefully

        notes have unique titles \u2013 that I won\u2019t, for example, have two notes
        in different folders both called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Short
        story ideas.md</code>.\nThat\u2019s true in my vault, but you might want to
        be careful using it if you reuse note titles.</p>\n\n<p>Now I can invoke my
        text cleanup scripts like so:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div

        class=\"si\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is especially
        useful when I want to run the same cleanup script on multiple notes in quick
        succession.\nI can run this command once, switch to Obsidian and select a
        new note, then return to my terminal and press <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">up-arrow</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">enter</code>
        to run the cleanup on my new note.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of other ways
        you could solve this problem \u2013 for example, I realised as I wrote this
        post that you could look at the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.obsidian/workspace.json</code>
        file \u2013 but this works for me, and I had a bit of fun while writing it.</p>\n\n\n

        started my new job, I\u2019ve been doing a lot more work in Python.\nAs I
        was starting with a completely clean slate, I wanted to try setting up Python
        the \u201Cright\u201D way \u2013 or if not <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1987/\">\u201Cright\u201D</a>,
        at least better way than my previous pile of hacks and kludges.</p>\n\n<p>(I
        don\u2019t remember much of my old approach, but I know it was messy.\nAt
        one point I used Homebrew and virtual environments, but I got burnt by Homebrew
        unexpectedly breaking Python, so I scrapped it and started installing everything
        in my global Python installation.\nDon\u2019t do that.)</p>\n\n<p>In August
        I read Glyph\u2019s post <a href=\"https://blog.glyph.im/2023/08/get-your-mac-python-from-python-dot-org.html\">Get
        Your Mac Python From Python.org</a> and it all seemed like sensible advice,
        so I decided to use that as my starting point.\nI downloaded Python on my
        new work laptop from Python.org, and I started using virtual environments
        for everything.</p>\n\n<p>This worked well enough, but there were some rough
        edges in my new workflow.\nI\u2019ve been tweaking <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scripts\">my
        Fish shell config</a> to make it a bit smoother.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"setting-the-pip_require_virtualenv-variable\">Setting
        the PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV variable</h2>\n\n<p>One recommendation in Glyph\u2019s
        post is that you <a href=\"https://blog.glyph.im/2023/08/get-your-mac-python-from-python-dot-org.html#and-always-use-virtual-environments\">always
        use virtual environments</a>, and they suggest a way to enforce that:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Once you have installed Python from python.org, never <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">pip install</code> anything globally into that Python,
        even using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--user</code>
        flag. Always, always use a virtual environment of some kind. In fact, I recommend
        configuring it so that it is not even possible to do so, by putting this in
        your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.pip/pip.conf</code>:</p>\n\n
        \ <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre
        class=\"highlight\"><code>[global]\nrequire-virtualenv = true\n</code></pre></div>
        \ </div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like the idea of always using virtualenvs,
        but I\u2019m not a fan of putting config files in my home directory.\nI struggle
        to keep them up-to-date, and after a while I lose track of what\u2019s what
        \u2013 is this config still in use, or is it cruft from a tool I no longer
        use?\nPlus, each config file becomes one more thing to remember when I set
        up a new computer.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, this config file isn\u2019t the
        only way to ensure you always use a virtual environment.\nYou can also <a
        href=\"https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/pip-virtualenv/#requiring-an-active-virtual-environment-for-pip\">set
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV</code></a>,
        so I have the following lines in my <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scripts/blob/767df24a19000ae4db09d387dda76a8812acc985/config.fish#L10-L18\">fish
        shell config</a>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-shell highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c\"># This
        prevents me from installing packages with pip without being</span>\n<span
        class=\"c\"># in a virtualenv first.</span>\n<span class=\"c\">#</span>\n<span
        class=\"c\"># This allows me to keep my system Python clean, and install all

        <span class=\"nt\">-x</span> PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV <span class=\"nb\">true</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Because
        I keep my shell config in Git, it\u2019s easier to see when I added this variable,
        and when I get a new computer I\u2019ll get this right behaviour \u201Cfor
        free\u201D.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-function-to-create-and-auto-enable-new-virtual-environments\">A
        function to create and auto-enable new virtual environments</h2>\n\n<p>The
        process of creating new virtual environments is ostensibly simple \u2013 just
        two commands.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span

        ever remembered to run the first \u2013 I\u2019d create my new virtual environment,
        go to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip install</code>
        something, and then it would complain I hadn\u2019t enabled a virtual environment.\nI\u2019d
        mutter and grumble, activate the virtualenv, and try again.</p>\n\n<p>If I\u2019m
        creating a virtual environment, I want to use it immediately, so I wrapped

        run this in the root of a project directory, usually a Git repo.</p>\n\n<p>When
        I run it, it creates a new virtual environment with an up-to-date version
        of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> (thanks
        to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--upgrade-deps</code>),
        then it activates it immediately.\nThis means my next command can be a <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip install</code>, and it\u2019ll
        run inside the new virtualenv.</p>\n\n<p>It also adds the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">.venv</code> directory to <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">.git/info/exclude</code>, which is a local-only gitignore
        file.\nThis means that Git will ignore my virtual environment, and not try
        to save it.\nThe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">grep</code>
        command is checking that I haven\u2019t already gitignore-d <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">.venv</code>, so I don\u2019t add repeated ignore rules.</p>\n\n<p>It
        also tells Time Machine not to bother backing up the virtual environment directory.\nI\u2019d
        never restore a virtualenv from a backup; I\u2019d just create a new one fresh,
        so backing it up is a waste of space and CPU cycles.</p>\n\n<p>I often combine
        this with another function I have for creating temporary directories:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-shell highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span
        class=\"k\">function </span>tmpdir <span class=\"nt\">--description</span>

        <span class=\"nt\">-d</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\nend\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>like
        so:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-console highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre
        class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>tmpdir<span
        class=\"p\">;</span> venv\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And with two short
        commands, I\u2019m in an empty directory with a fresh virtual environment.\nThis
        is great for quick prototyping, experiments, and one-off projects.</p>\n\n<h2
        id=\"auto-activating-virtual-environments-when-i-switch-directories\">Auto-activating
        virtual environments when I switch directories</h2>\n\n<p>Once I\u2019ve created
        my virtual environments, I need to remember to activate them.</p>\n\n<p>I
        could do this manually, or I could have the computer look for virtualenvs
        and (de)activate them automatically for me.\nThere are various plugins for
        doing this (I used <a href=\"https://virtualfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#auto-activation-auto-activation\">virtualfish</a>
        a few years ago), but this time round I realised my needs were simple enough
        that I could just write my own function.</p>\n\n<p>My <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> function ensures a standard approach to virtualenv
        naming: I always call them <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.venv</code>,
        and I put them in the root of my project directories, which are always Git
        repos.\nThis means I can find if there\u2019s a virtualenv I want to auto-activate
        by looking to see if I\u2019m in a Git repo, then looking for a folder called
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.venv</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This

        runs as an <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#event\">event
        handler</a> in Fish \u2013 it runs whenever the <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">PWD</code> variable changes.\nThat variable is the current
        working directory, so in practice this runs whenever I change directories.</p>\n\n<p>I
        find the top-level directory of the current Git repo by running <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-parse\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code></a>,
        which is a super handy command I use in lots of scripts.\nIf I\u2019m not
        in a Git repo, it returns an empty string.\nThen I compare that to the path
        of the currently-enabled virtualenv in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">VIRTUAL_ENV</code>,
        and decide whether I need to activate or deactivate a virtualenv.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If
        you want the complete code, my Fish shell config is <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwlchan/scripts\">in
        a public repo</a>, although the virtualenv stuff is a bit spread out.</p>\n\n<p>This
        was the first project where I used ChatGPT to help write the code.\nI was
        initially quite sceptical of LLMs, but watching <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/\">what
        Simon Willison has been doing</a> persuaded me to try it.\nThis felt like
        a safe project to try it \u2013 it\u2019s a minimal project with clearly defined
        \u201Cis the code working\u201D criteria, and limited impact if I do something
        daft.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I was quite impressed.\nAll the code seemed to work,
        and it was helpful for the bits of shell syntax I only half-remember \u2013
        things like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">test -z</code>
        and combining multiple conditions in a boolean.\nI didn\u2019t use any of
        its output directly, but it was a good starting point that I could adapt into
        my actual code.\nI\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be my last project where ChatGPT
        lends a helping hand.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks

        quite a few years, I\u2019ve been using fish (<a href=\"https://fishshell.com/\">https://fishshell.com/</a>)
        as my shell.</p>\n\n<p>One of the cool things it does is autosuggestions from
        my shell history.\nAs I\u2019m typing, it suggests (in light grey) a command
        I\u2019ve run before.\nI can press the right arrow to accept the suggestion,
        or I can keep typing to ignore it.</p>\n\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"/images/2023/fish_autosuggestion.dark_1x.png

        \ <img src=\"/images/2023/fish_autosuggestion_1x.png\" class=\"screenshot

        first is 'mate src/_drafts/forgetful-fish.md' and the second is 'make html'.
        For the third command, I've typed 'mate', and it\u2019s suggested the filename
        'src/_drafts/forgetful-fish.md' based on my first command.\" width=\"500\">\n</picture>\n\n<p>This
        feature is pretty smart and very useful, and it\u2019s probably saved me thousands
        of keystrokes.\nBut a few times recently it\u2019s gone wrong, and suggested
        me something I didn\u2019t want \u2013 so I\u2019ve been tweaking my fish
        config to make it easier for fish to \u201Cforget\u201D certain commands.</p>\n\n<h2
        id=\"what-i-dont-want-suggested\">What I don\u2019t want suggested</h2>\n\n<p>There
        are a couple of categories of command that I don\u2019t want fish to remember
        or suggest:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Typos and mistakes.</strong>\nIf
        I ever mistype a command and run it, that mistake will be used for future
        autosuggestions.\nGetting a command wrong once is annoying; having my mistake
        be continually suggested is worse.</p>\n\n    <p>A while back I mistyped <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hdiutil attach</code> as <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hdiutil atach</code>, and I
        kept getting the wrong version as an autosuggestion.\n(That annoyance is what
        led to the code in this post!)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Sensitive
        information.</strong>\nSometimes I end up with sensitive information in my
        shell commands \u2013 either by accident, or because it\u2019s the fastest
        way to fix a problem.\nI know I\u2019m not meant to do that, but nobody\u2019s
        perfect.</p>\n\n    <p>My fish shell history lives unencrypted in a file on
        disk, where anything could find it (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.local/share/fish/fish_history</code>).\nI\u2019d
        rather not have passwords, keys, and other credentials living there forever.</p>\n
        \ </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Potentially dangerous commands.</strong>\nMy
        example of this is doing a Git force push, which can delete data if I\u2019m
        not careful.\nIt\u2019s the right thing to do sometimes, but I never want
        to start typing a regular Git push and get a force push as an autosuggestion.</p>\n\n
        \   <p>I never want to do a force push accidentally, and I\u2019m willing
        to give up the benefits of autosuggestion for a bit of extra safety.</p>\n
        \ </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To help me avoid autosuggestion in these three cases,
        I\u2019ve added two functions to my shell config.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"function-1-forget-the-last-command\">Function
        #1: forget the last command</h2>\n\n<p>This function removes the last-typed
        command from my history, which prevents it from being suggested again.\nI
        run this manually, whenever I mistype a command or some other one-off thing
        I don\u2019t want to remember.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-shell highlighter-rouge\"><div
        class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">function

        class=\"s2\">\"</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">true\n</span>end\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>You
        can test this with the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Run a command like
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">echo \"my password is
        hunter2\"</code>\n</li>\n  <li>Type <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">echo</code>
        into your shell, and see that the previous command is suggested</li>\n  <li>Cancel
        that command, and instead, run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">forget_last_command</code>\n</li>\n
        \ <li>Start typing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">echo</code>
        again, and notice that the first command is no longer suggested</li>\n  <li>Open
        a new session, start typing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">echo</code>,
        and check that the first command isn\u2019t suggested</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The
        heavy lifting is done by fish\u2019s <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/history.html\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">history</code> command</a>
        \u2013 first it looks up the last command I typed, then it removes that from
        the history, and finally it persists that change to disk.</p>\n\n<p>(I\u2019m
        not entirely sure the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">history
        save</code> should be necessary, but with fish 3.6.1 \u2013 the latest version
        \u2013 it is required for this to work.\nI think there\u2019s something <a
        href=\"https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10066\">slightly funky</a>
        about <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">history delete
        --exact</code>, which made this maddening to debug until I started following
        my <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/history.html#customizing-the-name-of-the-history-file\"><code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fish_history</code> file</a>.)</p>\n\n<h2
        id=\"function-2-never-remember-certain-commands\">Function #2: never remember
        certain commands</h2>\n\n<p>Forgetting a command on a one-off basis is good
        for typos and accidental passwords, but what about commands I use on a semi-regular
        basis?\nIt\u2019d be annoying if I had to type <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">forget_last_command</code> every time I ran <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">git push --force</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This function looks
        at my last command, and if it\u2019s dangerous, it removes it from my history.\nCrucially,
        this runs as part of my shell prompt, so it runs as soon as a command completes
        \u2013 I don\u2019t need to remember to forget:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-shell
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span

        can test this with the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Switch to a Git
        repository where it\u2019s safe to force push</li>\n  <li>Run the command
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git push origin (gcb)
        --force</code> (here <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gcb</code>
        is an alias for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git rev-parse
        --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>, which prints the name of the currently checked-out
        branch)</li>\n  <li>Start typing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git
        push</code> again, and notice that the force push isn\u2019t suggested</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A
        force push is the only example of a dangerous command that I use regularly,
        but there could be others \u2013 anything involving <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">rm -rf</code>, for example.\nIf I ever find myself doing
        something dangerous that I never want suggested, it should be pretty easy
        to extend this function.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks

        of the last things I did at Wellcome Collection was writing a story about
        hyperfocus and how it affects my cross-stitch.\nI\u2019m really proud of this
        one, and I hope you\u2019ll consider reading.</p>\n\n<p>Writing for Stories
        was one of my \u201Cbucket list\u201D items while working at Wellcome, and
        I actually submitted the pitch on the same night I decided to start looking
        for new jobs.\nIt\u2019s among the more personal things I\u2019ve written,
        but I\u2019m really pleased with the result.\nI\u2019m incredibly grateful
        to Alice White (my editor) and Steven Pocock (who took the photographs) who
        helped turn my rough idea into something great, and a nice capstone for my
        time at Wellcome.</p>\n\n<p>There are photos of several of my finished or
        in-progress pieces in the article, which come from a variety of artists:</p>\n\n<ul>\n
        \ <li>\n<em>The World is Quiet Here</em> is a reference to the Lemony Snicket
        books, and <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1203491391/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-lemony\">the
        pattern is by NeatoBurritoStitches</a>.</li>\n  <li>\n<em>Vintage Clothes
        not Vintage Values</em> is <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/862043025/vintage-clothes-not-vintage-values-cross\">a
        pattern by HappySlothPatterns</a>.\nI changed the tint colour from a soft
        pink to a vibrant green, to match the frame I\u2019m planning to use.</li>\n
        \ <li>The black cat in the plants is one of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1244615562/funny-cats-cross-stitch-pattern-home\">a
        set of patterns by SamXstitch</a>, and I\u2019m working my way through the
        rest now.</li>\n  <li>The close-up stitching on black aida is from <em>Silver
        Needle</em> by perennial favourite Mathysphere, and was published <a href=\"https://xstitchmag.com/space-cross-stitch/\">in
        XStitch Magazine</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can read the story <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/ZRrH3RIAACIAALP5\">on

        approaching the limit of my current iCloud storage tier, and most of that
        is my Photos Library.\nI don\u2019t really want to pay for the next iCloud
        storage tier \u2013 I\u2019d be tripling my bill, but I\u2019d barely use
        the extra space.\n(My library grows pretty slowly \u2013 I\u2019ve only added
        ~6GB of photos this year.)</p>\n\n<p>What I\u2019d rather do is move some
        big items out of my library, and get some space back.\nI\u2019ve got <a href=\"/2023/blink/\">a
        pretty good workflow</a> for reviewing new photos, but what about ones from
        before I had my reviewing tool?</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a short Swift script which
        prints a list of all the largest files in my Photos Library.\nThe key part
        is two methods in PhotoKit: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phasset/1624783-fetchassets\">PHAsset.fetchAssets</a>
        to enumerate all the files, and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phassetresource/1623988-assetresources\">PHAssetResource.assetResources</a>
        to retrieve the original filename and file size.\nThe rest of the script takes
        the data and does some sorting and pretty-printing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift

        of 26k\_items, the script takes about about a minute or so to run.</p>\n\n<p>I
        went through the first 50 or so items, one-by-one.\nI moved about 30 videos
        out of my photos library and on to an external disk, and I deleted a few more
        \u2013 in total I recovered about 7GB of space.\nIt\u2019s not a lot, but
        it gives me some more breathing room.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much all these files
        were video messages I\u2019d made for friends and family, and sent as soon
        as they were recorded.\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever
        watch these again \u2013 I\u2019m keeping them just-in-case, but I definitely
        don\u2019t need them in my synced-everywhere photo library.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t
        know if I\u2019ll use this exact script again, but it was a good opportunity
        to practice using Swift and PhotoKit.\nI\u2019m gradually building a little
        collection of scripts and tools I can use to do stuff with photos, and this
        is another pebble on that pile.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this

        \   <content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2023/spotting-spam-in-our-cloudfront-logs/\"><![CDATA[\n<p>About
        two months ago, I wrote about some <a href=\"/2023/cloudfront-logs/\">Python
        code I\u2019d written to parse CloudFront logs</a>.\nI wrote this code to
        help with analysing some searches on wellcomecollection.org, and I thought
        it would be useful to explain a bit more of what I was doing.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s
        a lot of spam in the catalogue search.\nSomebody types in a search query which
        can\u2019t possibly return any results \u2013 instead it\u2019s a message
        (often not in English) promoting sketchy-sounding services and domains.\nCall
        me sceptical, but I don\u2019t think somebody who types in:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>escort
        girls in your area play free casino games \u2714\uFE0F with chatgpt \u23E9
        whatsapp scamalot.xyz\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>is actually looking
        for catalogue results in a library/museum website.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t
        know why people set up bots to do this \u2013 but whatever the reason, dealing
        with this sort of spam is an inevitable part of running a website on the public
        Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Before I started this work, we were sending all these
        spam queries to our back-end search API and Elasticsearch cluster.\nOver time,
        the load from the spam was starting to add up, and starting to crowd out real
        queries on our cluster.</p>\n\n<p>We wanted to find a way to identify the
        spam, so we could return a \u201Cno results page\u201D ASAP, without actually
        sending the query to our Elasticsearch cluster.\nIt was usually \u201Cobvious\u201D
        if you read the queries as a human, but how could we teach the computer to
        make the same distinction?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I started by using the code from

        gave me about 7\_million log entries that I could analyse.\nThen I started
        developing my spam heuristic, which had a single Python function as its interface:</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre
        class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">is_spam</span><span

        \   <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"bp\">False</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>To
        develop the heuristic, I wrote a bunch of versions of this function, trying
        various techniques to look at different fields in the log entry and decide
        if a particular request was spam.\nTo help me evaluate the different versions,
        I wrote a test script I could run repeatedly as I tweaked the function:</p>\n\n<div

        output gives me a summary with a few statistics:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Rejected
        = 5,136,696\nAllowed  = 1,805,073\n         = 74.00% marked as spam\nPer req
        \ = ~1.4436019812105793e-05s\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The proportion
        of rejected traffic is so I can see whether my proposed heuristic is actually
        making a difference to the volume of requests.\nThe per request time is for
        measuring performance; I didn\u2019t want to introduce noticeable latency
        for legitimate users.</p>\n\n<p>It also prints a random sample of the queries
        marked as legitimate and spam.\nThis gave me a spot check on the heuristic
        \u2013 I could see if legitimate queries were being rejected, or if I wanted
        to add another rule for matching spam.</p>\n\n<p>Repeatedly re-running this
        test harness gave me a workflow for developing my spam detection heuristic:
        I\u2019d tweak my function, re-run, and see how it affected the results.\nI
        kept iterating until I was catching a decent proportion of spam, without penalising
        real users.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Most of my analysis focused on the search query,
        and there were several patterns I spotted which seemed to be strong indicators
        of spam:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Certain keywords like <code class=\"language-plaintext
        highlighter-rouge\">chatgpt</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">casino</code>
        and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">crypto</code>.</p>\n\n
        \   <p>This was my first idea, because it was pretty obvious in the queries
        I was reading, but it was dropped from the final heuristic for two reasons.\nIt
        only dropped a fairly small amount of traffic (~2%) and it was hard to agree
        on a list of words that were definitely spam.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Emoji,
        of which \u23E9, \u2714\uFE0F, \u3299\uFE0F were particularly common examples.\nThere\u2019s
        no emoji in our catalogue data so it\u2019s unlikely a real person would search
        for it (and they won\u2019t find anything if they do!).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n
        \   <p>Long, all-Chinese queries.\nThere is some Chinese in the catalogue,
        but it\u2019s a tiny proportion \u2013  the vast majority of our data is in
        English.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Mangled character encodings, aka <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake\">Mojibake</a>.\nNot all of
        the non-English text was encoded properly, and there were a lot of queries
        like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\xE2\\x8f\xA9\xE2\\x9c\\x94\xEF\\x8f\xE3\\x8a</code>.\nI
        don\u2019t think a real person would ever type this in, but a poorly coded
        spam bot quite likely.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As I was going, I did tally
        some other fields in the logs I\u2019d marked as spam, to see if I could spot
        any other patterns I could use for spam detection \u2013 for example, I counted
        IP\_addresses to see if all the spam was coming from a single IP\_address
        that we could just block.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div

        find any good patterns this way, so I stuck to the query-based analysis.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For
        the first version of our spam detection, I settled on this heuristic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p><em>Reject queries with more than 25\_characters from character ranges
        which are rarely used in our catalogue data (Chinese, Korean, Mojibake, emoji)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later
        we reduced that threshold to 20, and so far it seems to have worked well.\nYou
        can see <a href=\"https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/509ef612b7a0ff4003f358ab2c637c544c0c870b/content/webapp/utils/spam-detector.ts#L94\">the

        associated tests</a> on GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>If your query is marked as spam,
        we now show the \u201Cno results\u201D page immediately in our frontend web
        app, rather than sending your search to our backend Elasticsearch cluster.\nAs
        part of this change, we tweaked the copy on our \u201Cno results\u201D page,

        week or so ago, I was hiking around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bohinj\">Lake
        Bohinj</a>, a gorgeous Alpine lake in northwest Slovenia.\nIt\u2019s a very
        photogenic landscape, so I was taking some pictures with my \u201Cnice\u201D
        camera.\nIt\u2019s an Olympus that takes better photos than my iPhone, but
        it\u2019s quite old and it doesn\u2019t have built-in GPS \u2013 so none of
        the photos have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging\">location
        geotags</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I find location data quite useful on my photos, and
        I was wondering if I could add it after the fact.\nAlthough my camera doesn\u2019t
        know where I was, I had a walking workout running on my Apple Watch, and that

        It\u2019s wondering what GPS and locations are.\" width=\"750\">\n</picture>\n\n<p>The
        first step was to get all the data from my walking workout.\nI was able to
        export the data from the Health app on my iPhone, following the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph5ede58c3d/ios#iphe962dcbd2\">instructions
        in an Apple Support document</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can export
        all of your health and fitness data from Health in XML format, which is a
        common format for sharing data between apps.</p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>Tap
        your picture or initials at the top right.</p>\n\n      <p>If you don\u2019t
        see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom of the screen,
        then scroll to the top of the screen.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>Tap
        Export All Health Data, then choose a method for sharing your data.</p>\n
        \   </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I tried this, my iPhone said
        it would take \u201Ca few moments\u201D.\nIt took much longer than that, and
        the lack of progress bar made me wonder if it was broken.</p>\n\n<p>But it
        did eventually finish, and fifteen minutes later, I had a 174MB ZIP file full
        of my health data.\nWhen I unzipped it, this is what it looked like inside:</p>\n\n<div

        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">trkpt</code> (\u201Ctrack points\u201D),
        each of which has a longitude, a latitude, an elevation and a timestamp.\nThe
        timestamps are in UTC \u2013 the first timestamp is just after 7am, but I
        didn\u2019t arrive at Bohinj until just after 9am.\nLike the rest of Slovenia,
        Bohinj is currently on UTC+2.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a couple of data points
        which I think are something related to direction and speed?\nI\u2019m not
        looking into those, but it was interesting to see they\u2019re in there.\nI
        don\u2019t think I\u2019ve worked with GPS data before, and there\u2019s a
        bit more than I expected \u2013 I thought I\u2019d just be getting longitude
        and latitude coordinates, but these extra values make sense, particular when
        I\u2019m walking.</p>\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://lxml.de/index.html\">lxml</a>
        to write a Python function which extracts all these track points from the
        file.\nThere are dedicated libraries for dealing with GPX files, but I already
        know how to use lxml and it was simple enough to write something for this
        one-off task.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div

        discovered that there are some duplicate timestamps in the GPX file \u2013
        although there\u2019s second-level precision, occasionally it would record
        two locations for the same time.\nThe two locations were pretty close, maybe
        a metre or so apart.\nFor this sort of casual photo analysis that\u2019s fine,
        but it might cause issues if you need more precision.</p>\n\n<p>Pulling them
        all into a dictionary means picking the last location that appeared in the

        much time on this so I called it good.\nBecause they\u2019re so close together,
        either is fine for my purposes.</p>\n\n<p>To tie this all together, I wrote
        a bit more Python which would find all the JPEG files from my camera, get
        the timestamp of that photo, and use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">exiftool</code>
        to add location metadata if my workout had recorded a location at that precise

        code has a big assumption at its core: that my Watch will have recorded a
        location at the precise second I took each photo.\nIn practice, that seems
        to work well enough \u2013 I don\u2019t know if my Watch is doing second-by-second
        location, but I\u2019d stand still to take my photos, and it would record
        at least one data point in that time.\nAll my photos from Bohinj got tagged.</p>\n\n<p>If
        this was an issue, you could write a looser heuristic to matching photos to
        location data in the workout \u2013 for example, using any location that was
        recorded within a few seconds of the photo being taken.\nBut \u201Csame second\u201D
        worked fine for me, so that\u2019s all I\u2019ve done.</p>\n\n<p>After I ran
        this code, I did some spot-checking of individual photos \u2013 it took a
        few tries to get the timezone handling correct.\nI\u2019d taken a photo of
        the <em>\u201CWelcome to Bohinj\u201D</em> sign right after I got off the
        bus, and that turned out to be super helpful \u2013 I knew exactly where it
        was, and I could keep tweaking my code until that photo got the right location.</p>\n\n<p>I
        was once given a tip: when travelling between time zones, take a photo of
        a clock that\u2019s correctly set to the local time.\nThat way, you can easily
        correct the time offset later if your camera was configured incorrectly.\nIf
        I plan to reuse this location tagging code, I\u2019d use the same trick, but
        with a photo of something in a known location.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Once this
        was done, I imported all the files into my Photos Library, and voila: I could
        see all my photos plotted on a map, even though I\u2019d taken them on a camera
        without GPS support.</p>\n\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"/images/2023/photos_on_map.dark_1x.png

        I\u2019d come into London for the day to hang out with a friend who lived
        near King\u2019s Cross.\nWe wandered up the Euston Road, popped into the British

        Reading Room</a>, which is a pretty common experience.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>I\u2019d
        already been thinking about getting a new job, so when I saw an ad for software
        developers at Wellcome a week later, it felt like the universe was telling
        me something.\nI applied, I was hired, and I started at the beginning of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>After
        nearly seven years, it\u2019s time for something new.\nI\u2019m going to be
        leaving Wellcome at the end of September, and joining <a href=\"https://www.flickr.org/\">the
        Flickr Foundation</a> as their new Tech Lead.</p>\n\n<p>This was a bittersweet
        decision.\nI\u2019ve loved my time at Wellcome.\nI got to work with a fantastic
        group of people, who\u2019ve helped me grow and learn and fix my mistakes.\nI\u2019m
        a much better person now than I was in 2017, and much of that comes from the
        people I met at Wellcome.\n(Of whom there are far, far too many to name.)</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve
        been able to work on a number of cool projects while I\u2019ve been at Wellcome,
        including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/collections\">unified
        collections search</a>, which combines records from across Wellcome\u2019s
        different catalogues into a single search box.\nThis was my first exposure
        to AWS, Elasticsearch and large-scale data pipelines, and I learnt a lot doing
        this project.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/wellcomecollection/storage-service\">storage
        service</a>, which is the permanent storage for Wellcome Collection\u2019s
        digital collections.\nI\u2019m proud of how robust and reliable it\u2019s
        become, and working on this will be a highlight of my entire software engineering
        career.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Helping to write Wellcome\u2019s first
        <a href=\"https://wellcome.org/news/our-trans-inclusion-policy-latest-step-making-wellcome-more-inclusive\">trans
        inclusion policy</a>.\nThis was a major milestone for the LGBTQ+ Staff Network,
        and helped me feel comfortable coming out at work in 2019.</p>\n  </li>\n
        \ <li>\n    <p>Getting my first experience of line management.\nI\u2019m immensely
        grateful that the team gave me feedback and patience in equal measure as I
        warmed up to this change \u2013 I made lots of mistakes in the first few months!</p>\n
        \ </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve stepped into a more managerial role, one
        of the most gratifying things has been to watch people take something that
        I worked on, and find ways to make it better.\nThe architecture of the catalogue
        pipeline has been streamlined and improved, making it more reliable and efficient.
        The trans inclusion policy has been rewritten with more detail and clarity.
        People are finding new ways to use the data in the storage service.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m
        leaving behind a remarkable team of smart, thoughtful, and capable people.\nI
        hope Wellcome knows just how lucky they are to have them.</p>\n\n<p>At the
        start of October, I\u2019ll be joining <a href=\"https://www.flickr.org/\">the
        Flickr Foundation</a> as their Tech Lead.\nThe mission \u2013 keeping Flickr\u2019s
        pictures visible for 100 years \u2013 is a daunting one, but I\u2019m excited
        about the challenge.\nI start in just under a fortnight, and I\u2019m really
        looking forward to it.</p>\n\n<p>This is a role I couldn\u2019t have done
        back in 2017 \u2013 I had no experience designing large systems, or managing
        a team, or doing software in a group that wasn\u2019t just software engineers.\nThose
        are all things I learnt while working at Wellcome.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m immensely
        grateful for my time at Wellcome Collection, for all the people I got to meet
        there, and for everything I learnt that\u2019s enabling me take this next
        step.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed
